lyWOEQAAQBAJ,Frankenstein,,Mary Shelley,Seven Books,2025-10-10,"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is an 1818 Gothic novel written by English author Mary Shelley. Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment that involved putting it together with different body parts. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 and staying in Bath, and the first edition was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared in the second edition, which was published in Paris in 1821. Shelley travelled through Europe in 1815, moving along the river Rhine in Germany, and stopping in Gernsheim, 17 kilometres (11 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, about a century earlier, Johann Konrad Dippel, an alchemist, had engaged in experiments. She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. Galvanism and occult ideas were topics of conversation for her companions, particularly for her lover and future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. In 1816, Mary, Percy, John Polidori, and Lord Byron had a competition to see who would write the best horror story.",214.0,Fiction,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=lyWOEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lyWOEQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-lyWOEQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lyWOEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

OqAFAQAAIAAJ,Mrs. Dalloway,,Virginia Woolf,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,1925,"Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. ""Mrs. Dalloway was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before Mrs. Dalloway aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with Mrs. Dalloway Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel asan art form has not been the same since. ""Mrs. Dalloway also contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it. It is one of the most moving, revolutionary artworks of the twentieth century."" --Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours",312.0,Fiction,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=OqAFAQAAIAAJ&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=3&source=gbs_api,,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OqAFAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

MRoMUV2kLZEC,Mysteries,,Knut Hamsun,Penguin,2001-01-01,"The first complete English translation of the Nobel Prize-winner’s literary masterpiece A Penguin Classic Mysteries is the story of Johan Nilsen Nagel, a mysterious stranger who suddenly turns up in a small Norwegian town one summer—and just as suddenly disappears. Nagel is a complete outsider, a sort of modern Christ treated in a spirit of near parody. He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the “insulted and injured,” and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of prussic acid... The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel's stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.",322.0,Fiction,en,4.5,14.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api,,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
9zfmEAAAQBAJ,Frankenstein,The Original 1818 'Uncensored' Edition,Mary Shelley,Good Press,2023-12-27,"Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' is a groundbreaking work of gothic literature that explores themes of ambition, isolation, and the consequences of playing god. Written in an epistolary format, the reader is drawn into the chilling tale of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, the monster. Shelley's descriptive prose and use of multiple narrators create a sense of foreboding and unease, making 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic in the literary canon. The novel also raises ethical questions about scientific responsibility and the limits of human knowledge, making it a thought-provoking read for modern audiences. Mary Shelley's personal experiences, including the death of her own children and her tumultuous relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, undoubtedly influenced the creation of 'Frankenstein.' Her unique perspective as a female author in the 19th century adds layers of depth to the story, highlighting the societal expectations and constraints faced by women of her time. I highly recommend 'Frankenstein' to readers who enjoy thought-provoking literature that delves into the darker aspects of human nature and morality.",234.0,Fiction,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=9zfmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9zfmEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9zfmEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9zfmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Prince Lyov Nikolaevich Myshkin, a young man whose goodness and open-hearted simplicity lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting ""the positively good and beautiful man."" The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved.

Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols and newer customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.""",116.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=H0uczQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=82&source=gbs_api,,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H0uczQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

x-1VtAEACAAJ,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,,Arthur Conan Doyle,Wingspan Press,2008-11,"First serialized in 1887 in London magazines, Sherlock Holmes remains the greatest detective of all time. He was an instant hit with the public with his incisive mind and fearless approach to the truth. At a time when forensic science was just beginning to emerge, Holmes became the master of arcane knowledge and the criminal mind. His stunning leaps of deduction were the bane of England's evildoers and the envy of Scotland Yard. Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes off in 1891 when he tired of writing the stories, but public demand forced him to revive his hero shortly thereafter, and he continued with further adventures until 1927. Doyle wrote four Sherlock Holmes novels, and his short stories have been collected into five anthologies. Published over an astounding forty years, from A Study in Scarlet in 1887, to his final short stories published between 1921 and 1927, Holmes continues to thrill today. His name still evokes a vision of the smoking pipe and deerstalker hat, and remains synonymous with clever deduction and the ability to ferret out the truth from a maze of conflicting evidence. Enjoy all of Sherlock Holme's exploits in WingSpan Classic books.

The convict terrifies Pip and threatens to kill him unless the boy helps further his escape. Later, Pip finds himself in a ruined garden where he meets the embittered and crazy Miss Havisham and her foster child, Estella, with whom he instantly falls in love. After a secret benefactor gives him a fortune, Pip moves to London, where he cultivates great expectations for a life that would allow him to discard his impoverished beginnings and socialize with members of the idle upper class. As Pip struggles to become a gentleman, he slowly learns the truth about himself and his illusions, and is tormented endlessly by the beautiful Estella. Written in the last decade of Dickens's life, Great Expectations reveals the author's dark attitudes toward Victorian society, its inherent class structure, and its materialism.

LC0hjwEACAAJ,Theresa Raquin,,Émile Zola,,2016-01-06,"Émile Zola is one of the greatest writers of the 19th century, and one of France's best known citizens. In his life, Zola was the most important exemplar of the literary school of naturalism and a major figure in the political liberalization of France. Around the end of his life, Zola was instrumental in helping secure the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, a victim of anti-Semitism. The Dreyfus Affair was encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline J'Accuse. More than half of Zola's novels were part of this set of 20 collectively known as Les Rougon-Macquart. Unlike Honore de Balzac, who compiled his works into La Comedie Humaine midway through, Zola mapped out a complete layout of his series. Set in France's Second Empire, the series traces the ""environmental"" influences of violence, alcohol and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the Industrial Revolution. The series examines two branches of a family: the respectable Rougons and the disreputable Macquarts for five generations. Zola explained, ""I want to portray, at the outset of a century of liberty and truth, a family that cannot restrain itself in its rush to possess all the good things that progress is making available and is derailed by its own momentum, the fatal convulsions that accompany the birth of a new world.""",142.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=LC0hjwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=168&source=gbs_api,,Fiction,

n2D6DwAAQBAJ,Human by Design,From Evolution by Chance to Transformation by Choice,Gregg Braden,Hay House,2017,"Human by Design invites you on a journey beyond Darwin's theory of evolution, beginning with the fact that we exist as we do, even more empowered, and more connected with ourselves and the world, than scientists have believed possible.* * *In one of the great ironies of the modern world, the science that was expected to solve life's mysteries has done just the opposite. New discoveries have led to more unanswered questions, created deeper mysteries, and brought us to the brink of forbidden territory when it comes to explaining our origin and existence. These discoveries reveal the following facts: - Fact 1. Our origin--Modern humans appeared suddenly on earth approximately 200,000 years ago, with the advanced brain, nervous system, and capabilities that set them apart from all other known forms of life already developed, rather than having developed slowly and gradually over a long periods of time.- Fact 2. Missing physical evidence--The relationships shown on the conventional tree of human evolution are speculative connections only. While they are believed to exist, a 150-year search has failed to produce the physical evidence that confirms the relationships shown on the evolutionary family tree.- Fact 3. New DNA evidence--The comparison of DNA between ancient Neanderthals, previously thought to be our ancestors, and early humans tells us that we did not descend from the Neanderthals.- Fact 4. A rare DNA fusion--Advanced genome analysis reveals that the DNA that sets us apart from other primates, including in our advanced brain and nervous system, is the result of an ancient and precise fusion of genes occurring in a way that suggests something beyond evolution made our humanness possible.- Fact 5. Our extraordinary abilities--We are born with the capacity to self-heal, to self-regulate longevity, to activate an enhanced immune response, and to experience deep intuition, sympathy, empathy, and, ultimately, compassion--and to do each of these on demand.In this book, New York Times best-selling author and 2017 Templeton Award nominee Gregg Braden crosses the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality to answer the timeless question at the core of our existence--Who are we?--and to reveal science-based techniques that awaken our uniquely human experiences of deep intuition, precognition, advanced states of self-healing, and much more! Beyond any reasonable doubt, Human by Design reveals that we're not what we've been told, and much more than we've ever imagined.",321.0,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=n2D6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nonfiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=7&source=gbs_api,,Nonfiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n2D6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

z68yEAAAQBAJ,In the Closet of The Vatican,"Power, Homosexuality, Hypocrisy",Frédéric Martel,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019,"The New York Times Bestseller'[An] earth-shaking exposé of clerical corruption' - National Catholic ReporterIn the Closet of the Vatican exposes the rot at the heart of the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church today. This brilliant piece of investigative writing is based on four years' authoritative research, including extensive interviews with those in power. The celibacy of priests, the condemnation of the use of contraceptives, the cover up of countless cases of sexual abuse, the resignation of Benedict XVI, misogyny among the clergy, the dramatic fall in Europe of the number of vocations to the priesthood, the plotting against Pope Francis - all these issues are clouded in mystery and secrecy.In the Closet of the Vatican is a book that reveals these secrets and penetrates this enigma. It derives from a system founded on a clerical culture of secrecy which starts in junior seminaries and continues right up to the Vatican itself. It is based on the double lives of priests and on extreme homophobia. The resulting schizophrenia in the Church is hard to fathom. But the more a prelate is homophobic, the more likely it is that he is himself gay.'Behind rigidity there is always something hidden, in many cases a double life'. These are the words of Pope Francis himself and with them the Pope has unlocked the Closet.No one can claim to really understand the Catholic Church today until they have read this book.

2gIYnwEACAAJ,The Band that Played on,The Extraordinary Story of the 8 Musicians who Went Down with the Titanic,Steve Turner,,2012-09-26,"""They kept it up to the very end. Only the engulfing ocean had power to drown them into silence. The band was playing 'Nearer, My God, to Thee.' I could hear it distinctly. The end was very close."" --CHARLOTTE COLLYER, TITANIC SURVIVOR The movies, the documentaries, the museum exhibits. They often tell the same story about the ""unsinkable"" Titanic, her wealthy passengers, the families torn apart, and the unthinkable end. But never before has ""that glorious band""--the group of eight musicians who played on as the Titanic slipped deeper and deeper into the Atlantic Ocean--been explored in such depth. Steve Turner's extensive research reveals a fascinating story including dishonest agents, a clairvoyant, social climbers, and a fraudulent violin maker. Read what brought the band members together and how their music served as the haunting soundtrack for one of modern history's most tragic maritime disasters. BOOK REVIEWS The Band that Played On by Steve Turner is, surprisingly, the first book since the great ship went down to examine the lives of the eight musicians who were employed by the Titanic. What these men did'standing calmly on deck playing throughout the disaster'achieved global recognition. But their individual stories, until now, have been largely unknown. What Turner has uncovered is a narrow but unique slice of history'one more chapter of compelling Titanic lore. Turner, a music journalist, pursued living relatives of the band members and squeezed all that he could out of ""inherited photographs, documents, and anecdotes"" enabling him to sketch brief but poignant portraits of eight young (or at least youngish) men, all born in an optimistic era and all members of the rising middle class. To their parents, their girlfriends, and surely to themselves as well, the future must have seemed bright right up until the early morning hours of April 15, 1912... There is much that we do not know about the final hours of these men. Why did they make the decision to play on the deck that night? What was in their hearts and minds? ... Even the Titanic survivors who witnessed their final performance quibbled over some details. Did the band march or did they kneel? Was their last number ""Autumn"" or was it ""Nearer, My God, to Thee""? Did they stop playing during the final moments and pack their instruments away or were they still playing as the ship went down? All agreed, however, that all eight band members behaved with remarkable calm and courage. Within hours of the ship's sinking, their story was circulating and they had already become heroes... For Turner, however, the undisputed hero of the book is Wallace Hartley, a fine musician with religious conviction and a powerful sense of duty who seems most likely to have been the force behind those final hours of heroism. In the last pages of the book, Turner reveals a surprising Hartley discovery'a turn of events which makes a fine ending for his worthy book, even as it leaves us hopeful that the Titanic may yet have a few mysteries she is willing to give up. --Marjorie Kehe, Book Editor, Christian Science Monitor",0.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=2gIYnwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Nonfiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=48&source=gbs_api,,Nonfiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2gIYnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

LFlJuQEACAAJ,The Grandmaster,Magnus Carlsen and the Match that Made Chess Great Again,Brin-Jonathan Butler,,2018,"A firsthand account of the dramatic 2016 World Chess Championship between Norway's Magnus Carlsen and Russia's Sergey Karjakin, which mirrored the world's geopolitical unrest and rekindled a global fascination with the sport. The first week of November 2016, as a crowd of people swarmed outside of Manhattan's Trump Tower to rail against the election of Donald Trump, hundreds more descended on the city's South Street Seaport. But they weren't there to protest. They were there to watch the World Chess Championship between Norway's Magnus Carlsen and Russia's Sergey Karjakin--what by the time it was over would be front-page news and thought by many the greatest finish in chess history. The story lines were riveting. The championship hadn't been hosted in New York City, the de facto world capital of the sport, in more than two decades. With both Carlsen and Karjakin just 25 years old, the tournament organizers were billing it as a battle of the millennials--the first time the championship had been waged among the generation that grew up playing chess primarily against computers. And perhaps most intriguing were all the geopolitical connections to the match. Originally from Crimea, Karjakin had recently repatriated to Russia under the direct assistance of Putin. Carlsen, meanwhile, had expressed admiration for Donald Trump, and his first move of the tournament he played with a smirk what's called a Trompowsky Attack. Then there was the Russian leader of the World Chess Federation being barred from attending due to US sanctions, and chess fanatic and Trump adviser Peter Thiel being called on to make the honorary first move in sudden death. That the tournament required sudden death was a shock. Oddsmakers had given Carlsen, the defending champion, an 80% chance of winning. It would take everything he had to retain his title. In doing so, he would firmly make his case to be considered the greatest player chess has ever seen. Author Brin-Jonathan Butler was granted unique access to the two-and-half-week tournament and watched every move. In The Grandmaster, he aims to do for Magnus Carlsen what Norman Mailer did for Muhammed Ali in The Fight, John McPhee did for Arthur Ashe in Levels of the Game, and David Foster Wallace did for Roger Federer in his famous New York Times Magazine profile. Butler captures one of the world's greatest sportsmen at the height of their powers, and attempts to decipher the secret to that greatness.",0.0,Chess players,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=LFlJuQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Nonfiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=81&source=gbs_api,,Nonfiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LFlJuQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

fR1xDwAAQBAJ,The Down Goes Brown History of the NHL,"The World's Most Beautiful Sport, the World's Most Ridiculous League",Sean McIndoe,,2018,"Sean McIndoe of Down Goes Brown, one of hockey's favourite and funniest writers, takes aim at the game's most memorable moments--especially if they're memorable for the wrong reasons--in this warts-and-all history of the NHL. The NHL is, indisputably, weird. One moment, you're in awe of the speed, skill and intensity that define the sport, shaking your head as a player makes an impossible play, or shatters a longstanding record, or sobs into his first Stanley Cup. The next, everyone's wearing earmuffs, Mr. Rogers has shown up, and guys in yellow raincoats are officiating playoff games while everyone tries to figure out where the league president went. That's just life in the NHL, a league that often can't seem to get out of its own way. No matter how long you've been a hockey fan, you know that sinking feeling that maybe, just maybe, some of the people in charge here don't actually know what they're doing. And at some point, you've probably wondered: Has it always been this way? The short answer is yes. As for the longer answer, well, that's this book. In this fun, irreverent and fact-filled history, Sean McIndoe relates the flip side to the National Hockey League's storied past. His obsessively detailed memory combines with his keen sense for the absurdities that make you shake your head at the league and yet fanatically love the game, allowing you to laugh even when your team is the butt of the joke (and as a life-long Leafs fan, McIndoe takes the brunt of some of his own best zingers).

c2PQvr6mnj0C,Australia's Greatest Inventions,From Boomerangs to the Hills Hoist,Lynda De Lacey,Exisle Publishing,2007,"Australia has a reputation for innovation and inventiveness — that famous 'tie it up with fence-wire' attitude towards getting things done is one of our best-known national characteristics. Popular opinion tells us that a knack for adaptation — for jerry rigging and so-called 'bush improvisation' — is one of the qualities that marks us out as Australian. If you had to play 'spot the Australian' among other nationalities, you'd choose the ones with the duct tape and pliers in their hands. But ask your average Aussie to reel off a list of uniquely Australian inventions at a pub trivia night, and most won't get much further than the stump-jump plough, the Hills Hoist, Speedos and the pavlova. Suddenly you may find yourself wondering if we're all that inventive as a culture after all? These examples certainly don't seem to build a terribly convincing case. This book proves that for a 200-year-old culture with a relatively small population, Australians have a much richer inventive history than we give ourselves credit for. Once we've seen that this reputation for inventiveness is justified, the next question becomes: is there something in our cultural wiring, something about being Australian, that makes us more inventive than other people? This book is part of Exisle Publishing's Little Red Books series. Every title in the Little Red Books series provides an overview of key events, people or places in Australian history.

Dreger's chronicle begins with her own research into the treatment of people born intersex (once called hermaphrodites). Realization of the shocking surgical and ethical abuses conducted in the name of ""normalizing"" intersex children's gender identities moved Dreger to become an internationally recognized patient rights activist. But even as the intersex rights movement succeeded, Dreger began to realize how some fellow activists were using lies and personal attacks to silence scientisis whose data revealed uncomfortable truths about humans. In researching one case, Dreger suddenly became a target of just these kinds of attacks. Troubled, she decided to try to understand more -- to travel the country and seek a global view of the nature and costs of these damaging battles. Galileo's Middle Finger describes Dreger's long and harrowing journeys between the two camps for which she felt equal empathy: social justice activists determined to win and researchers determined to put hard truths before comfort. What emerges is a lesson about the intertwining of justice and truth-- and about the importance of responsible scholars and journalists to our fragile democracy."" --",370.0,Biography & Autobiography,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=qArTCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Nonfiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=130&source=gbs_api,,Nonfiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qArTCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

yi93xQEACAAJ,Parkland,Birth of a Movement,Dave Cullen,Harper Paperbacks,2020-02-11,"A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER On the first anniversary of the events at Parkland, the acclaimed, New York Times bestselling author of Columbine offers an intimate, deeply moving account of the extraordinary teenage survivors who became activists and pushed back against the NRA and feckless Congressional leaders--inspiring millions of Americans to join their grassroots #neveragain movement. Nineteen years ago, Dave Cullen was among the first to arrive at Columbine High, even before most of the SWAT teams went in. While writing his acclaimed account of the tragedy, he suffered two bouts of secondary PTSD. He covered all the later tragedies from a distance, working with a cadre of experts cultivated from academia and the FBI, but swore he would never return to the scene of a ghastly crime. But in March 2018, Cullen went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School because something radically different was happening. In nearly twenty years witnessing the mass shootings epidemic escalate, he was stunned and awed by the courage, anger, and conviction of the high school's students. Refusing to allow adults and the media to shape their story, these remarkable adolescents took control, using their grief as a catalyst for change, transforming tragedy into a movement of astonishing hope that has galvanized a nation. Cullen unfolds the story of Parkland through the voices of key participants whose diverse personalities and outlooks comprise every facet of the movement. Instead of taking us into the minds of the killer, he takes us into the hearts of the Douglas students as they cope with the common concerns of high school students everywhere--awaiting college acceptance letters, studying for mid-term exams, competing against their athletic rivals, putting together the yearbook, staging the musical Spring Awakening, enjoying prom and graduation--while moving forward from a horrific event that has altered them forever. Deeply researched and beautifully told, Parkland is an in-depth examination of this pivotal moment in American culture--and an up-close portrait that reveals what these extraordinary young people are like as kids. As it celebrates the passion of these astonishing students who are making history, this spellbinding book is an inspiring call to action for lasting change.",400.0,Education,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=yi93xQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Nonfiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=170&source=gbs_api,,Nonfiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yi93xQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Br-Ho0rlFGwC,Alexander the Great,,Philip Freeman,Simon and Schuster,2011-01-04,"In the first authoritative biography of Alexander the Great written for a general audience in a generation, classicist and historian Philip Freeman tells the remarkable life of the great conqueror. The celebrated Macedonian king has been one of the most enduring figures in history. He was a general of such skill and renown that for two thousand years other great leaders studied his strategy and tactics, from Hannibal to Napoleon, with countless more in between. He flashed across the sky of history like a comet, glowing brightly and burning out quickly: crowned at age nineteen, dead by thirty-two. He established the greatest empire of the ancient world; Greek coins and statues are found as far east as Afghanistan. Our interest in him has never faded. Alexander was born into the royal family of Macedonia, the kingdom that would soon rule over Greece. Tutored as a boy by Aristotle, Alexander had an inquisitive mind that would serve him well when he faced formidable obstacles during his military campaigns. Shortly after taking command of the army, he launched an invasion of the Persian empire, and continued his conquests as far south as the deserts of Egypt and as far east as the mountains of present-day Pakistan and the plains of India. Alexander spent nearly all his adult life away from his homeland, and he and his men helped spread the Greek language throughout western Asia, where it would become the lingua franca of the ancient world. Within a short time after Alexander’s death in Baghdad, his empire began to fracture. Best known among his successors are the Ptolemies of Egypt, whose empire lasted until Cleopatra. In his lively and authoritative biography of Alexander, classical scholar and historian Philip Freeman describes Alexander’s astonishing achievements and provides insight into the mercurial character of the great conqueror. Alexander could be petty and magnanimous, cruel and merciful, impulsive and farsighted. Above all, he was ferociously, intensely competitive and could not tolerate losing—which he rarely did. As Freeman explains, without Alexander, the influence of Greece on the ancient world would surely not have been as great as it was, even if his motivation was not to spread Greek culture for beneficial purposes but instead to unify his empire. Only a handful of people have influenced history as Alexander did, which is why he continues to fascinate us.",418.0,Biography & Autobiography,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=Br-Ho0rlFGwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=4&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Br-Ho0rlFGwC&rdid=book-Br-Ho0rlFGwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Br-Ho0rlFGwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

inND87EFFF4C,By the Sword,"A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions",Richard Cohen,Modern Library,2007-12-18,"“Like swordplay itself, By the Sword is elegant, accurate, romantic, and full of brio—the definitive study, hugely readable, of man’s most deadly art.”—Simon Winchester With a new Preface by the author Napoleon fenced. So did Shakespeare, Karl Marx, Grace Kelly, and President Truman, who as a schoolboy would practice fencing with Bess—his future wife— when the two of them returned home from school. Lincoln was a canny dueler. Ignatius Loyola challenged a man to a duel for denying Christ’s divinity (and won). Less successful, but no less enthusiastic, was Mussolini, who would tell his wife he was “off to get spaghetti,” their code to avoid alarming the children. By the Sword is an epic history of sword fighting—a science, an art, and, for many, a religion that began at the dawn of civilization in ancient Egypt and has been an obsession for mankind ever since. With wit and insight, Richard Cohen gives us an engrossing history of the world via the sword. Praise for By the Sword “Touché! While scrupulous and informed about its subject, Richard Cohen’s book is about more than swordplay.

FqK0DgAAQBAJ,METEOROLOGY,,Aristotle,右灰文化傳播有限公司可提供下載列印,2017-04-20,"�WE have already discussed the first causes of nature, and all natural motion, also the stars ordered in the motion of the heavens, and the physical element-enumerating and specifying them and showing how they change into one another-and becoming and perishing in general. There remains for consideration a part of this inquiry which all our predecessors called meteorology. It is concerned with events that are natural, though their order is less perfect than that of the first of the elements of bodies. They take place in the region nearest to the motion of the stars. Such are the milky way, and comets, and the movements of meteors. It studies also all the affections we may call common to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts. These throw light on the causes of winds and earthquakes and all the consequences the motions of these kinds and parts involve. Of these things some puzzle us, while others admit of explanation in some degree. Further, the inquiry is concerned with the falling of thunderbolts and with whirlwinds and fire-winds, and further, the recurrent affections produced in these same bodies by concretion. When the inquiry into these matters is concluded let us consider what account we can give, in accordance with the method we have followed, of animals and plants, both generally and in detail. When that has been done we may say that the whole of our original undertaking will have been carried out.�",166.0,Philosophy,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=FqK0DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=10&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FqK0DgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FqK0DgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FqK0DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
1ROJDwAAQBAJ,Redrawing the Middle East,"Sir Mark Sykes, Imperialism and the Sykes-Picot Agreement",Michael D. Berdine,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-03-30,"The Sykes-Picot Agreement was one of the defining moments in the history of the modern Middle East. Yet its co-creator, Sir Mark Sykes, had far more involvement in British Middle East strategy during World War I than the Agreement for which he is now most remembered. Between 1915 and 1916, Sykes was Lord Kitchener's agent at home and abroad, operating out of the War Office until the war secretary's death at sea in 1916. Following that, from 1916 to 1919 he worked at the Imperial War Cabinet, the War Cabinet Secretariat and, finally, as an advisor to the Foreign Office. The full extent of Sykes's work and influence has previously not been told. Moreover, the general impression given of him is at variance with the facts. Sykes led the negotiations with the Zionist leadership in the formulation of the Balfour Declaration, which he helped to write, and promoted their cause to achieve what he sought for a pro-British post-war Middle East peace settlement, although he was not himself a Zionist. Likewise, despite claims he championed the Arab cause, there is little proof of this other than general rhetoric mainly for public consumption. On the contrary, there is much evidence he routinely exhibited a complete lack of empathy with the Arabs. In this book, Michael Berdine examines the life of this impulsive and headstrong young British aristocrat who helped formulate many of Britain's policies in the Middle East that are responsible for much of the instability that has affected the region ever since.",344.0,Biography & Autobiography,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=1ROJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=41&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ROJDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1ROJDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ROJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time.The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions.

_hN1EAAAQBAJ,Hitler's Gift,The True Story of the Scientists Expelled by the Nazi Regime,"Jean Medawar, David Pyke",Skyhorse,2012-01-12,"Between 1901 and 1932, Germany won a third of all the Nobel Prizes for science. With Hitler's rise to power and the introduction of racial laws, starting with the exclusion of all Jews from state institutions, Jewish professors were forced to leave their jobs, which closed the door on Germany’s fifty-year record of world supremacy in science. Of these more than 1,500 refugees, fifteen went on to win Nobel Prizes, several co-discovered penicillin—and more of them became the driving force behind the atomic bomb project. In this revelatory book, Jean Medawar and David Pyke tell countless gripping individual stories of emigration, rescue, and escape, including those of Albert Einstein, Fritz Haber, Leo Szilard, and many others. Much of this material was collected through interviews with more than twenty of the surviving refugee scholars, so as to document for history the steps taken after Hitler’s policy was enacted. As one refugee scholar wrote, “Far from destroying the spirit of German scholarship, the Nazis had spread it all over the world. Only Germany was to be the loser.” Hitler’s Gift is the story of the men who were forced from their homeland and went on to revolutionize many of the scientific practices that we rely on today. Experience firsthand the stories of these geniuses, and learn not only how their deportation affected them, but how it bettered the world that we live in today.",278.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=_hN1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=47&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_hN1EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_hN1EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_hN1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

mdKlDgAAQBAJ,The Greatest Comeback: From Genocide To Football Glory,The Story of Béla Guttman,David Bolchover,Biteback Publishing,2017-05-18,"Shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award 2017. Longlisted for the Coutts Football Writers Association Award 2018. Before Pep Guardiola and before José Mourinho, there was Béla Guttmann: the first superstar football coach, and the man who paved the way for the celebrated coaches of the modern age. More extraordinarily still, Guttmann was a Holocaust survivor. Having narrowly dodged death by hiding for months in an attic near Budapest as thousands of fellow Jews in the neighbourhood were dragged off to be murdered, Guttmann later escaped from a slave labour camp. He was one of the lucky ones. His father, sister and wider family perished at the hands of the Nazis. But by 1961, as coach of Benfica, he had lifted one of football's greatest prizes: the European Cup a feat he repeated the following year. Rising from the death pits of Europe to become its champion in just over sixteen years, Guttmann performed the single greatest comeback in football history. This remarkable story spans two visions of twentieth-century Europe: a continent ruptured by barbarism and genocide, yet lit up by exhilarating encounters in magnificent cities, where great players would strive to win football s holy grail. With dark forces rising once again, the story of Béla Guttmann s life asks the question: which vision of Europe will triumph in our times?",247.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=mdKlDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=50&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mdKlDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mdKlDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mdKlDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
qy7kHYbrLJsC,Chinese Among Others,Emigration in Modern Times,Philip A. Kuhn,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2008-03-27,"In this book, distinguished historian Philip A. Kuhn tells the remarkable five-century story of Chinese emigration as an integral part of China's modern history. Although emigration has a much longer past, its ""modern"" phase dates from the sixteenth century, when European colonialists began to collaborate with Chinese emigrants to develop a worldwide trading system. The author explores both internal and external migration, complementary parts of a far-reaching process of adaptation that enabled Chinese families to deal with their changing social environments. Skills and institutions developed in the course of internal migration were creatively modified to serve the needs of emigrants in foreign lands. As emigrants, Chinese inevitably found themselves ""among others."" The various human ecologies in which they lived have faced Chinese settlers with a diversity of challenges and opportunities in the colonial and postcolonial states of Southeast Asia, in the settler societies of the Americas and Australasia, and in Europe. Kuhn traces their experiences worldwide alongside those of the ""others"" among whom they settled: the colonial elites, indigenous peoples, and rival immigrant groups that have profited from their Chinese minorities but also have envied, feared, and sometimes persecuted them. A rich selection of primary sources allows these protagonists a personal voice to express their hopes, sorrows, and worldviews. The post-Mao era offers emigrants new opportunities to leverage their expatriate status to do business with a Chinese nation eager for their investments, donations, and technologies. The resulting ""new migration,"" the author argues, is but the latest phase of a centuries-old process by which Chinese have sought livelihoods away from home.",453.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=qy7kHYbrLJsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=81&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qy7kHYbrLJsC&rdid=book-qy7kHYbrLJsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qy7kHYbrLJsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

urr8QQAACAAJ,Sport in Ancient Times,,Nigel B. Crowther,,2010,"A lively survey encompassing the Orient, the Americas, and the classical world From the Olympic Games of Greece to the gladiatorial contests of Rome, sport in the ancient world was fiercely competitive and included a wider range of physical contests than we moderns might suspect. The early Chinese played forms of polo and golf, while half a world away, Hohokam and Maya Indians enjoyed team ball games. Nigel Crowther, a leading authority on classical Greek sport, here casts his net over the entire ancient world to reveal the variety, and often the intensity, of sport in earlier times, from 3000 b.c.e. to the Middle Ages. Taking in twenty premodern societies on five continents--with particular emphasis on ancient Greece and Rome and the Byzantine Empire--he traces connections to modern sporting attitudes, practices, and institutions as he describes how athletics figured in cultural arenas that extended beyond physical prowess to ritual, social status, military associations, and politics. Crowther takes us back to the birth of sumo wrestling in Japan and describes the sports of the Sumerians and Hittites. He documents bull leaping and boxing as recorded on pottery in Crete, as well as running and archery as practiced by the pharaohs in Egypt. He shows the significance of the early Olympic Games, describes the Romans' use of gladiatorial contests for political ends, and analyzes the influence of Byzantine chariot racing on society. He also notes the changing role of women in ancient sports--from their prominence in Egyptian contests, to the mythological Atalanta, to female Roman gladiators. As informative as it is entertaining, Sport in Ancient Times opens new vistas for general readers, students, and sport historians. It offers a broad look at ancient sport and will enrich readers' appreciation of games they enjoy today.",0.0,Sports,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=urr8QQAACAAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=89&source=gbs_api,,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urr8QQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

fH5lAAAAMAAJ,"Writers, Readers, and Reputations",Literary Life in Britain 1870-1918,Philip Waller,OUP Oxford,2006-04-27,"Writers, Readers, and Reputations explores the literary world in which the modern best-seller first emerged. Writers were promoted as stars and celebrities, advertising both products and themselves. Philip Waller's detailed and entertaining study is a collective biography of literary figures, some forgotten, some enduring, over half a century. - ;Charles Dickens died in 1870, the same year in which universal elementary education was introduced. During the following generation a mass reading public emerged, and the term 'best-seller' was coined. In new and cheap editions Dickens's stories sold hugely, but these were progressively outstripped in quantity by the likes of Hall Caine and Marie Corelli, Charles Garvice and Nat Gould. Who has now heard of these writers? Yet Hall Caine, for one, boasted of having made more money from his pen than any previous author. This book presents a panoramic view of literary life in Britain over half a century from 1870 to 1914, teasing out authors' relations with the reading public and tracing how reputations were made and unmade. It surveys readers' habits, the book trade, popular literary magazines and the role of reviewers, and examines the construction of a classical canon by critics concerned about the supposed corruption of popular taste. Certain writers were elevated as national heroes, yet Britain drew its writers from abroad as well as from home. Authors became stars and celebrities, and a literary tourism grew around their haunts. They advertised products from cigarettes to toothpaste; they were fashion-conscious and promoted themselves via profiles, interviews, and carefully posed photographs; they went on lecture tours to America; and their names were pushed by a new professional breed: the literary agent. Some angled for knighthoods, even peerages, and cut a figure in high society and London clubland. The debated public issues of the day and campaigned on all manner of things from questions of faith and women's rights to censorship and conscription. During the Great War they penned propaganda. Meanwhile the cinema was developing to challenge the supremacy of the written word over the imagination. Authors took to that too, as an opportunity for new adventure. Writers, Readers, and Reputations is richly entertaining and informative, amounting to a collective biography of a generation of writers and their world. - ;the remarkable thing about this extraordinary book is that throughout its thousand pages it remains consistently readable, enjoyable, and informative... Waller's style is addictive and discursive...and the reader will gain greatly the more that she or he reads - William Whyte, EHR, cxxi 494;The richness of Waller's study is beyond question. This is an extraordinary mine of fact, detail, quotation, anecdote and reminiscence. Every reader, no matter how familiar with the literature of the period, will learn from the range of its excavations. - Dinah Birch, TLS;[A] serious achievement...It will prove an invaluable resource to scholars seeking a reference tool on a huge range of topics, not only because of its coverage, but because Waller produces the kind of scholarship on which one can rely. - The Cambridge Quarterly, Vol. 36, No. 1;...a magnificent study, one that will be recognised as a defining literary history of the period. - The Review of English Studies, Vol58, No. 233",1208.0,Fiction,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=fH5lAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=123&source=gbs_api,,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fH5lAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

GAiAswEACAAJ,The History and Literature of the Crusades (Classic Reprint),,Heinrich Von Sybel,Forgotten Books,2017-05-27,"Excerpt from The History and Literature of the Crusades The first part of the work now submitted to the public, is a translation of the lectures delivered at Munich; the second part is taken from the preface to his History of the First Crusade, published in 1841 and consists of an elaborate criticism on the various original authorities in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and on the later historians of the Crusades, down to the present time. There exists, we believe, no such critical examination of the ori ginal authorities in any other language. The refer ences to them in Mills's History of the Crusades are somewhat meagre; while\ Michaud, although in his Bibliotheque des Croisades he has given ample extracts, has nowhere subjected the originals to the rigorous and minute analysis they undergo at the hands of the German Professor. The first impulse to a critical examination of the original authorities of the First Crusade was given by Professor Ranke in his Historical Exercises He began with the first books of William of Tyre, which he proved to be merely a repetition of earlier accounts by Albert of Aix, Ray mond of Agiles, and from the 'gesta Francorum.' He then examined Albert of Aix, whose work he considered to be derived chieﬂy from oral tradition. Professor Ranke's other avocations prevented his pursuing this subject any further; but sufficient was done to clear the way for other historical stu dents; and v. Sybel has carried out the method of his eminent teacher. The narrative of the First Crusade, as given by Mills and other modern historians, v. Sybel re gards as a mingled mass of truth and falsehood, of history and legend, founded chieﬂy on the account of William of Tyre. William of Tyre wrote in 1170, and with much that was valuable, he mixed tales borrowed from Albert of Aix The general character of the work is thought by the German Professor to be poetical and legendary.

MxIUDAAAQBAJ,Conservation Biology for All,,"Navjot S. Sodhi, Paul R. Ehrlich",Oxford University Press,2010-01-07,"Conservation Biology for All provides cutting-edge but basic conservation science to a global readership. A series of authoritative chapters have been written by the top names in conservation biology with the principal aim of disseminating cutting-edge conservation knowledge as widely as possible. Important topics such as balancing conversion and human needs, climate change, conservation planning, designing and analyzing conservation research, ecosystem services, endangered species management, extinctions, fire, habitat loss, and invasive species are covered. Numerous textboxes describing additional relevant material or case studies are also included. The global biodiversity crisis is now unstoppable; what can be saved in the developing world will require an educated constituency in both the developing and developed world. Habitat loss is particularly acute in developing countries, which is of special concern because it tends to be these locations where the greatest species diversity and richest centres of endemism are to be found. Sadly, developing world conservation scientists have found it difficult to access an authoritative textbook, which is particularly ironic since it is these countries where the potential benefits of knowledge application are greatest. There is now an urgent need to educate the next generation of scientists in developing countries, so that they are in a better position to protect their natural resources.",369.0,Nature,en,4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=MxIUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MxIUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

LSm6MLV42zgC,Beyond War,The Human Potential for Peace,Douglas P. Fry,Oxford University Press,2007-02-16,"The classic opening scene of 2001, A Space Odyssey shows an ape-man wreaking havoc with humanity's first invention--a bone used as a weapon to kill a rival. It's an image that fits well with popular notions of our species as inherently violent, with the idea that humans are--and always have been--warlike by nature. But as Douglas P. Fry convincingly argues in Beyond War, the facts show that our ancient ancestors were not innately warlike--and neither are we.Fry points out that, for perhaps ninety-nine percent of our history, for well over a million years, humans lived in nomadic hunter-and-gatherer groups, egalitarian bands where generosity was highly valued and warfare was a rarity. Drawing on archaeology and fascinating fieldwork on hunter-gatherer bands from around the world, Fry debunks the idea that war is ancient and inevitable. For instance, among Aboriginal Australians--who numbered some 750,000 individuals before the arrival of Europeans, all living in hunter-gathering groups--warfare was an extreme anomaly. There was individual violence and aggression, of course, but the Aborigines had sophisticated methods of resolving disputes, controlling individual outbursts, and preventing loss of life. Fry shows that, far from being natural, warfare actually appeared quite recently along with changes in social organization and especially the rise of states. But Fry also points out that even today, when war seems ever present (at least on television), the vast majority of us live peaceful, nonviolent lives. We are not as warlike as it might seem, and if we can learn from our ancestors, we may be able to move beyond war to provide real justice and security for the people of the world.A profoundly heartening view of human nature, Beyond War offers a hopeful perspective on our species and a positive prognosis for a future without war.",353.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=LSm6MLV42zgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=41&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LSm6MLV42zgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

JqB6Qy9z3TcC,How We Became Posthuman,"Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics",N. Katherine Hayles,University of Chicago Press,2024-05-31,"In this age of DNA computers and artificial intelligence, information is becoming disembodied even as the ""bodies"" that once carried it vanish into virtuality. While some marvel at these changes, envisioning consciousness downloaded into a computer or humans ""beamed"" Star Trek-style, others view them with horror, seeing monsters brooding in the machines. In How We Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles separates hype from fact, investigating the fate of embodiment in an information age. Hayles relates three interwoven stories: how information lost its body, that is, how it came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material forms that carry it; the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg; and the dismantling of the liberal humanist ""subject"" in cybernetic discourse, along with the emergence of the ""posthuman."" Ranging widely across the history of technology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Hayles shows what had to be erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. Thus she moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel Limbo by cybernetics aficionado Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems. Although becoming posthuman can be nightmarish, Hayles shows how it can also be liberating. From the birth of cybernetics to artificial life, How We Became Posthuman provides an indispensable account of how we arrived in our virtual age, and of where we might go from here.",364.0,Science,en,4.0,7.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=JqB6Qy9z3TcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=46&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JqB6Qy9z3TcC&rdid=book-JqB6Qy9z3TcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JqB6Qy9z3TcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this book, eleven leading historians of science assess what their field has taught us about this exciting time and identify issues that remain unexamined or require reconsideration. They treat both scientific disciplines—biology, physics, chemistry, the earth sciences, mathematics, and the social sciences—in their specific intellectual and sociocultural contexts as well as the broader topics of science and medicine; science and religion; scientific institutions and communities; and science, technology, and industry. Providing a much-needed overview and analysis of a rapidly expanding field, From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences will be essential for historians of science, but also of great interest to scholars of all aspects of nineteenth-century life and culture.

CKxwuQEACAAJ,Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,Isaac Newton,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-07-02,"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy: Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton and translated into English by Andrew Motte, added to Newton's System of The World. Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often referred to as simply the Principia, is a work in three books by Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published 5 July 1687. After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition, Newton published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726. The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics; Newton's law of universal gravitation; and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically). SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things : and the moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeavoured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards philosophy. The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical mechanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name. But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accurate is called geometrical , what is less so, is called mechanical.",374.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=CKxwuQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=82&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CKxwuQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

FD7YtQEACAAJ,The Origin of Species,,Charles Darwin,,1979,"Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific imagination, The Origin of Species sold out on the day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England, and, as the Saturday Review noted, the uproar over the book quickly ""passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street."" Yet, after reading it, Darwin's friend and colleague T. H. Huxley had a different reaction: ""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that."" Based largely on Darwin's experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H.M.S. Beagle, The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species. A landmark con- tribution to philosophical and scientific thought, this edition also includes an introductory historical sketch and a glossary Darwin later added to the original text. Charles Darwin grew up considered, by his own account, ""a very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard of intellect."" A quirk of fate kept him from the career his father had deemed appro- priate--that of a country parson--when a botanist recommended Darwin for an appointment as a naturalist aboard H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Darwin is also the author of the five-volume work Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and The Descent of Man (1871).",459.0,Science,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=FD7YtQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=84&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FD7YtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

zieQDwAAQBAJ,What I Require From Life,Writings on science and life from J.B.S. Haldane,Krishna Dronamraju,Oxford University Press,2009-01-22,"J. B. S. Haldane (1892-64) was one of the scientific giants of the 20th century. A polymath who made important contributions to sciences ranging from physiology to genetics and biochemistry, he was also a highly skilled writer and an extraordinary character - brilliant, witty, idealistic, funny, and pugnacious. What I Require From Life is a compilation of his popular scientific essays written from the 1940s to last years of his life, that reflect not only his masterful ability to communicate scientific understanding, but also his deep commitment to socialism. The essays included here fall into two groups; those written by Haldane during the 1940s when he embraced Marxism, and those written during his last years in India (1957-64), and they range from An Autobiography in Brief (written three years before his death), to his Marxist view of evolution The Chicken or the Egg? , to his poignant poem Cancer is a Funny Thing. Edited with an introduction by Haldane's last graduate pupil, Professor Krishna Dronamraju, this collection of thought-provoking and beautifully-written science writing also comes with a Preface written by the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who provides a personal perspective on Haldane's unique place in 20th century science.",268.0,Science,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=zieQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=88&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zieQDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zieQDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zieQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

To meet the need for an up-to-date introduction to the field, Akhtar S. Khan and Sujian Huang have written Continuum Theory of Plasticity--a truly modern text which offers a continuum mechanics approach as well as a lucid presentation of the essential classical contributions. The early chapters give the reader a review of elementary concepts of plasticity, the necessary background material on continuum mechanics, and a discussion of the classical theory of plasticity. Recent developments in the field are then explored in sections on the Mroz Multisurface model, the Dafalias and Popov Two Surface model, the non-linear kinematic hardening model, the endochronic theory of plasticity, and numerous topics in finite deformation plasticity theory and strain space formulation for plastic deformation. Final chapters introduce the fundamentals of the micromechanics of plastic deformation and the analytical coupling between deformation of individual crystals and macroscopic material response of the polycrystal aggregate. For graduate students and researchers in engineering mechanics, mechanical, civil, and aerospace engineering, Continuum Theory of Plasticity offers a modern, comprehensive introduction to the entire subject of plasticity.",434.0,Science,en,5.0,3.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=l1FPaaY355gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=89&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l1FPaaY355gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.",272.0,Science,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=uSaEmgEACAAJ&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=121&source=gbs_api,,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uSaEmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In the Efe community in Zaire, infants routinely use machetes with safety and some skill, although U.S. middle-class adults often do not trust young children with knives. What explains these marked differences in the capabilities of these children? Until recently, traditional understandings of human development held that a child's development is universal and that children have characteristics and skills that develop independently of cultural processes. Barbara Rogoff argues, however, that human development must be understood as a cultural process, not simply a biological or psychological one. Individuals develop as members of a community, and their development can only be fully understood by examining the practices and circumstances of their communities.",449.0,Social Science,en,5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=HSkaQ3FTsLIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=124&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HSkaQ3FTsLIC&rdid=book-HSkaQ3FTsLIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HSkaQ3FTsLIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

N., During the Years 1832 to 1836, Vol. 3: Birds, by John Gould, Esq. F. L. S When I presented my collection of Birds to the Zoological Society, Mr. Gould kindly undertook to furnish me with descriptions of the new Species and names of those already known. This he has performed, but owing to the hurry, consequent on his departure for Australia, - an expedition from which the science of Ornithology will derive such great advantages, -he was compelled to leave some part of his manuscript so far incomplete, that without the possibility of personal communication with him, I was left in doubt on some essential points. Mr. George Robert Gray, the ornithological assistant in the Zoological depart ment of the British Museum, has in the most obliging manner undertaken to obviate this difficulty, by furnishing me with information with respect to some parts of the general arrangement, and likewise on that most intricate subject, the knowledge of what species have already been described, and the use of proper generic terms. I shall endeavour in every part of the text to refer to Mr. G. R. Gray's assistance, where I have used it. As some of Mr. Gould's descriptions appeared to me brief, I have enlarged them, but have always endeavoured to retain his Specific character; so that, by this means, I trust I shall not throw any obscurity on what he considers the essential character in each case; but at the same time, I hope, that these additional remarks may render the work more complete.

This evidence forms the basis for identifying risks to crew health and performance during extended space missions, as well as for developing countermeasures to mitigate these risks. In this edition, you'll read how space agencies are currently gearing up for human missions beyond low-Earth orbit, which necessitates addressing numerous physiological, psychological, operational, and scientific challenges prior to establishing bases on the surface of Moon and Mars. The emerging commercial sub-orbital and orbital flight capabilities have captivated both the public and the scientific community.

These beliefs were formulated by the Athenian followers of Zeno in the fourth century BC, but it was in Seneca (c. 4 BC– AD 65) that the Stoics found their most eloquent advocate. Stoicism, as expressed in the Letters, helped ease pagan Rome’s transition to Christianity, for it upholds upright ethical ideals and extols virtuous living, as well as expressing disgust for the harsh treatment of slaves and the inhumane slaughters witnessed in the Roman arenas. Seneca’s major contribution to a seemingly unsympathetic creed was to transform it into a powerfully moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.",294.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=NGv8ndfpxqIC&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NGv8ndfpxqIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Dialectic of Enlightenment is one of the most celebrated works of modern social philosophy that continues to impress in its wide-ranging ambition. Writing just after the Second World War and reflecting on the bureaucracy and myths of National Socialism and the inanity of the dawn of consumerism, Adorno and Horkheimer addressed themselves to a question which went to the very heart of the modern age: 'why mankind, instead of entering into a truly human condition, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism'. Modernity, far from redeeming the promises and hopes of the Enlightenment, had resulted in a stultification of mankind and administered society, characterised by simulation and candy-floss entertainment.

EfzOBwAAQBAJ,The Oxford Handbook of Prosocial Behavior,,"David A. Schroeder, William G. Graziano",,2015,"The Oxford Handbook of Prosocial Behavior provides a comprehensive review of the current literature on when and why people act to benefit others. It provides a comprehensive overview of the field to give both the casual reader and the neophyte to the field some perspective about fundamental questions (what, why, when, and who) relative to prosocial behavior. Taking a multi-level approach, the chapters represent the broad spectrum of this multi-faceted domain. Topics range from micro-level analyses involving evolutionary and comparative psychological factors to macro-level applications, such as reducing intergroup conflicts and ethnic genocide. Between these extremes, the contributors--all internationally recognized in their field--offer their perspectives on developmental processes that may predispose individuals to empathize with and respond to the needs of others, individual differences that seem to interact with situational demands to promote helping, and the underlying motivations of those helping others. They explain volunteerism, intragroup cooperation, and intergroup cooperation to move the analysis from the individual to group-level phenomena. They extend the consideration of this topic to include support of pro-environmental actions, means to encourage participation in medical clinical trials, and the promotion of world peace. The ways that gender, interpersonal relationships, race, and religion might affect decisions to give aid and support to others are also addressed. The final chapter offers a unique view of prosocial behavior that encourages researchers and readers to take an even broader consideration of the field to search for a prosocial consilience.",817.0,Philosophy,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=EfzOBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=44&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EfzOBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Playful and irreverent, these aphorisms will surprise you by exposing self-delusions you have been living with but never recognized.

JPQ8DAAAQBAJ,Greek Philosophical Terms,A Historical Lexicon,Francis E. Peters,NYU Press,1967,"Combining the convenience of a dictionary with the depth of a history of philosophy, this new reference book fills a great need and should prove exceedinly useful to all students and scholars in classics, philosophy, theology and linguistics. The book defines and translates key terms used by pre-Christian philosophers up to the time of Proclus, with special references to the writings of the philosophers as they developed nuances and new meanings for the terms. Entries are arranged in dictionary style, but a knowledge of Greek is not necessary to use the book, since an English-Greek index provides the reader with Greek equivalents of English terms, with cross-reference to the main text. Its great value is that it isolates terms and allows the reader to follow their individual careers, while at the same time it offers an evolutionary history of the concept instead of a mere definition.",249.0,Foreign Language Study,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=JPQ8DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=85&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JPQ8DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
JypDtAEACAAJ,The Ethics of Aristotle,,Aristotle,,2017-06,"Aristotle conceived of the term 'ethics' as a way of examining the moral thought of his teacher Plato, and Plato's contemporary Socrates. Wishing to keep a simple definition, Aristotle conceived of ethics as the moral and behavioural ideal of the way in which human life is conducted. The philosopher's principle work of moral philosophy is entitled Nicomachean Ethics, and is comprised of ten distinct books. In order to properly define ethical behaviour, Aristotle attempts to conceive of a society that is ideal in the sense of securing the maximum happiness for the entire population. After defining the nature of happiness, Aristotle commences to discuss the various virtues people may aspire to in order to live ethically. Various topics are discussed as the discussion evolves, with concepts such as justice and asceticism, touched upon throughout the text. Aristotle is keen to emphasise the various human emotions which can curtail the human being who aspires to be ethical, and emphasises that the journey to becoming a decent and upstanding person involves a high degree of self-mastery. Having first appeared in 1908, the iteration of the Ethics presented here has stood the test of time. It continues to be cited and favoured by numerous scholars to this day, being as it faithfully replicates the timeless thoughts, ideas and reflections of the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.",,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=JypDtAEACAAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=86&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JypDtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

AlYk0QEACAAJ,Ecce Homo,,Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Double 9 Books,2025,"Ecce Homo by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche is an autobiographical work that offers a deep self-analysis as the philosopher reflects on his life, health, and ideas. The book explores his personal struggles with illness and solitude, which played a crucial role in shaping his philosophical perspective. Nietzsche critiques prevailing societal values and presents himself as a revolutionary thinker challenging conventional morality. His narrative blends bravado with vulnerability, presenting his ability to perceive life from both strength and decay as the foundation of his wisdom. The work captures Nietzsche s unique voice, emphasizing his individualism and the complex relationship between his experiences and intellectual development. His self-portrayal is both candid and provocative, asserting the nobility of his philosophy while positioning it against established norms. Ecce Homo is not just a personal memoir but a philosophical statement that invites readers to reconsider their understanding of existence, suffering, and the cultural ideals of his time, reflecting Nietzsche s mission to reshape values and challenge traditional thought.",0.0,Literary Criticism,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=AlYk0QEACAAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=88&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AlYk0QEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

O3MhuQEACAAJ,Thus Spake Zarathustra,,Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-06-30,"Rare edition with unique illustrations and elegant classic cream paper. Thus Spake Zarathustra is certainly Nietzsche's most controversial and probably his most important work. The concepts that ""God is Dead"" and ""Eternal Recurrence"" with their attendant ramifications are major features of this work. Highly original and inventive, Thus Spake Zarathustra defies simple categorization. Part literature, part philosophy, it parodies both, in its stylistic resemblance to the New Testament and Pre-Socratic Greek writings. Through a fictionalized version the character Zarathustra, the legendary founder of Zoroasterianism, Nietzsche propounds a new and different version of moral philosophy. During the course of the story presented in this loosely structured narrative, Nietzsche develops and presents a contrary view of mankind: as lying somewhere between the apes and the ultimate Superman, or Ubermensch. Ranging from unsupported assumptions to rigorous argument - from exposition to dialog to poetry - Thus Spake Zarathustra is a surprising, engaging and thought provoking look at the con ition of mankind. Nietzsche himself considered this to be his most important work. His tragic end, in a state of complete mental breakdown, precluded any possibility that it would be superseded and raised a question of the association between madness and genius.

yLF7hxDPWNoC,Karl Marx,The Burden of Reason (why Marx Rejected Politics and the Market),Allan Megill,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2002,"Why did Karl Marx want to exclude politics and the market from his vision of a future socialism? In Karl Marx: The Burden of Reason, Allan Megill begins with this question. Megill's examination of Marx's formative writings casts new light on Marx's relation to philosophy and reveals a hitherto largely unknown 'rationalist' Marx. In demonstrating how Marx's rationalism permeated his attempts to understand politics, economics, and history generally, Megill forces the reader to rethink Marx's entire intellectual project. While Megill writes as an intellectual historian and historian of philosophy, his highly original redescription of the Marxian enterprise has important implications for how we think about the usability of Marx's work today. Karl Marx: The Burden of Reason will be of interest to those who wish to reflect on the fate of Marxism during the era of Soviet Communism. It will also be of interest to those who wish to discern what is living and what is dead, what is adequate and what requires replacement or supplementation, in the work of a figure who, in spite of everything, remains one of the greatest philosophers and social scientists of the modern world.",404.0,History,en,3.0,1.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=yLF7hxDPWNoC&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=123&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yLF7hxDPWNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
sDoqAQAAMAAJ,The Varieties of Religious Experience,A Study in Human Nature,William James,Modern Library,1936,"""The Varieties of Religious Experience is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century,"" said Walter Houston Clark in Psychology Today. The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902. Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life. James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis. ""James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book,"" noted Professor Martin E. Marty.

BhypzwEACAAJ,Candide,,Voltaire,,1918,"Ever since 1759, when Voltaire wrote ""Candide"" in ridicule of the notion that this is the best of all possible worlds, this world has been a gayer place for readers. Voltaire wrote it in three days, and five or six generations have found that its laughter does not grow old.""Candide"" has not aged. Yet how different the book would have looked if Voltaire had written it a hundred and fifty years later than 1759. It would have been, among other things, a book of sights and sounds. A modern writer would have tried to catch and fix in words some of those Atlantic changes which broke the Atlantic monotony of that voyage from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. When Martin and Candide were sailing the length of the Mediterranean we should have had a contrast between naked scarped Balearic cliffs and headlands of Calabria in their mists. We should have had quarter distances, far horizons, the altering silhouettes of an Ionian island. Colored birds would have filled Paraguay with their silver or acid cries.Dr. Pangloss, to prove the existence of design in the universe, says that noses were made to carry spectacles, and so we have spectacles. A modern satirist would not try to paint with Voltaire's quick brush the doctrine that he wanted to expose. And he would choose a more complicated doctrine than Dr. Pangloss's optimism, would study it more closely, feel his destructive way about it with a more learned and caressing malice. His attack, stealthier, more flexible and more patient than Voltaire's, would call upon us, especially when his learning got a little out of control, to be more than patient. Now and then he would bore us. ""Candide"" never bored anybody except William Wordsworth.Voltaire's men and women point his case against optimism by starting high and falling low. A modern could not go about it after this fashion. He would not plunge his people into an unfamiliar misery. He would just keep them in the misery they were born to.",0.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=BhypzwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=127&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BhypzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
LaIFugEACAAJ,The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,,"Aurelius, Marcus",,2018-07-29,"Meditations (""thoughts/writings addressed to himself"") is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor 161-180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy. Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in ""highly-educated"" Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title Meditations is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs. His stoic ideas often involve avoiding indulgence in sensory affections, a skill which, he says, will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. An order or logos permeates existence. Rationality and clear-mindedness allow one to live in harmony with the logos. This allows one to rise above faulty perceptions of ""good"" and ""bad.""",166.0,Ethics,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=LaIFugEACAAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=128&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LaIFugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

How was this possible? How could intellectuals whose work depends on freedom defend those who would deny it? In profiles of six leading twentieth-century thinkers—Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Alexandre Kojève, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida—Mark Lilla explores the psychology of political commitment. As continental Europe gave birth to two great ideological systems in the twentieth century, communism and fascism, it also gave birth to a new social type, the philotyrannical intellectual. Lilla shows how these thinkers were not only grappling with enduring philosophical questions, they were also writing out of their own experiences and passions. These profiles demonstrate how intellectuals can be driven into a political sphere they scarcely understand, with momentous results. In a new afterword, Lilla traces how the intellectual world has changed since the end of the cold war. The ideological passions of the past have been replaced in the West, he argues, by a dogma of individual autonomy and freedom that both obscures the historical forces at work in the present and sanctions ignorance about them, leaving us ill-equipped to understand those who are inflamed by the new global ideologies of our time.",249.0,Philosophy,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=qGA9DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=162&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGA9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

From the dawn of philosophy, the question concerning the summum bonum, or, what is the same thing, concerning the foundation of morality, has been accounted the main problem in speculative thought, has occupied the most gifted intellects, and divided them into sects and schools, carrying on a vigorous warfare against one another. And after more than two thousand years the same discussions continue, philosophers are still ranged under the same contending banners, and neither thinkers nor mankind at large seem nearer to being unanimous on the subject, than when the youth Socrates listened to the old Protagoras, and asserted (if Plato's dialogue be grounded on a real conversation) the theory of utilitarianism against the popular morality of the so-called sophist.",106.0,Philosophy,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=KKfznQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Philosophy&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=163&source=gbs_api,,Philosophy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KKfznQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Hayes,Guilford Press,2013-04-22,"Explaining the fundamentals of mediation and moderation analysis, this engaging book also shows how to integrate the two using an innovative strategy known as conditional process analysis. Procedures are described for testing hypotheses about the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, the conditions under which they occur, and the moderation of mechanisms. Relying on the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew Hayes carefully explains the estimation and interpretation of direct and indirect effects, probing and visualization of interactions, and testing of questions about moderated mediation. Examples using data from published studies illustrate how to conduct and report the analyses described in the book. Of special value, the book introduces and documents PROCESS, a macro for SPSS and SAS that does all the computations described in the book. The companion website (www.afhayes.com) offers free downloads of PROCESS plus data files for the book's examples. Unique features include: *Compelling examples (presumed media influence, sex discrimination in the workplace, and more) with real data; boxes with SAS, SPSS, and PROCESS code; and loads of tips, including how to report mediation, moderation and conditional process analyses. *Appendix that presents documentation on use and features of PROCESS. *Online supplement providing data, code, and syntax for the book's examples.",527.0,Psychology,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=8YX2QwGgD8AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=2&source=gbs_api,,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8YX2QwGgD8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

VdhAAQAAQBAJ,Visible Learning and the Science of How We Learn,,"John Hattie, Gregory C. R. Yates",Routledge,2013-10-08,"On publication in 2009 John Hattie’s Visible Learning presented the biggest ever collection of research into what actually work in schools to improve children’s learning. Not what was fashionable, not what political and educational vested interests wanted to champion, but what actually produced the best results in terms of improving learning and educational outcomes. It became an instant bestseller and was described by the TES as revealing education’s ‘holy grail’. Now in this latest book, John Hattie has joined forces with cognitive psychologist Greg Yates to build on the original data and legacy of the Visible Learning project, showing how it’s underlying ideas and the cutting edge of cognitive science can form a powerful and complimentary framework for shaping learning in the classroom and beyond. Visible Learning and the Science of How We Learn explains the major principles and strategies of learning, outlining why it can be so hard sometimes, and yet easy on other occasions. Aimed at teachers and students, it is written in an accessible and engaging style and can be read cover to cover, or used on a chapter-by-chapter basis for essay writing or staff development. The book is structured in three parts – ‘learning within classrooms’, ‘learning foundations’, which explains the cognitive building blocks of knowledge acquisition and ‘know thyself’ which explores, confidence and self-knowledge. It also features extensive interactive appendices containing study guide questions to encourage critical thinking, annotated bibliographic entries with recommendations for further reading, links to relevant websites and YouTube clips. Throughout, the authors draw upon the latest international research into how the learning process works and how to maximise impact on students, covering such topics as: teacher personality; expertise and teacher-student relationships; how knowledge is stored and the impact of cognitive load; thinking fast and thinking slow; the psychology of self-control; the role of conversation at school and at home; invisible gorillas and the IKEA effect; digital native theory; myths and fallacies about how people learn. This fascinating book is aimed at any student, teacher or parent requiring an up-to-date commentary on how research into human learning processes can inform our teaching and what goes on in our schools. It takes a broad sweep through findings stemming mainly from social and cognitive psychology and presents them in a useable format for students and teachers at all levels, from preschool to tertiary training institutes.",380.0,Education,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=VdhAAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdhAAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VdhAAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VdhAAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

GjEkAgAAQBAJ,Measurement Theory in Action,"Case Studies and Exercises, Second Edition","Kenneth S Shultz, David J. Whitney, Michael J Zickar",Routledge,2013-11-20,"This book helps readers apply testing and measurement theories. Featuring 22 self-standing modules, instructors can pick and choose the ones that are most appropriate for their course. Each module features an overview of a measurement issue and a step-by-step application of that theory. Best practices provide recommendations for ensuring the appropriate application of the theory. Practical questions help students assess their understanding of the topic while the examples allow them to apply the material using real data. Two cases in each module depict typical dilemmas faced when applying measurement theory followed by Questions to Ponder to encourage critical examination of the issues noted in the cases. Each module contains exercises some of which require no computer access while others involve the use of SPSS to solve the problem. The book’s website houses the accompanying data sets and more. The book also features suggested readings, a glossary of the key terms, and a continuing exercise that incorporates many of the steps in the development of a measure of typical performance. Updated throughout to reflect recent changes in the field, the new edition also features: --A new co-author, Michael Zickar, who updated the advanced topics and added the new module on generalizability theory (Module 22). -Expanded coverage of reliability (Modules 5 & 6) and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (Modules 18 & 19) to help readers interpret results presented in journal articles. -Expanded Web Resources, Instructors will now find: suggested answers to the book’s questions and exercises; detailed worked solutions to the exercises; and PowerPoint slides. Students and instructors can access the SPSS data sets; additional exercises; the glossary; and website references that are helpful in understanding psychometric concepts. Part 1 provides an introduction to measurement theory and specs for scaling and testing and a review of statistics. Part 2 then progresses through practical issues related to text reliability, validation, meta-analysis and bias. Part 3 reviews practical issues related to text construction such as the development of measures of maximal performance, CTT item analysis, test scoring, developing measures of typical performance, and issues related to response styles and guessing. The book concludes with advanced topics such as multiple regression, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory (IRT), IRT applications including computer adaptive testing and differential item functioning, and generalizability theory. Ideal as a text for any psychometrics, testing and measurement, or multivariate statistics course taught in psychology, education, marketing and management, professional researchers in need of a quick refresher on applying measurement theory will also find this an invaluable reference.",419.0,Psychology,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=GjEkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=49&source=gbs_api,,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GjEkAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
jbWoEAAAQBAJ,The Error of Narcissus,,Louis Lavelle,TOLDO EDITORIAL,,"In ""The Error of Narcissus,"" Louis Lavelle (1883-1951) presents a philosophical meditation on the myth of Narcissus. He argues that self-realization, far from being a self-centered admiration, requires not turning against oneself but acting and reaching out to others. In this book, Lavelle explores the concept of self. For Lavelle, the self is movement, becoming, overcoming anxiety, and freedom. Based on the hero from Ovid's story, who was fascinated by his own image in water, he shows in brief meditations that the self is threatened with death if it remains fixed on itself, on an object, and in the past. What is most secret in the self can only be understood in its relationship with others, in the reception of other subjectivities. Self-consciousness must then be found to liberate the soul and access the spiritual space. Louis Lavelle was for a long time unjustly forgotten. Today, rediscovered, the importance of his work seems perfectly suited to what we are living. Lavelle includes human sciences, psychoanalysis, and anthropology in an essay that reveals him as one of the great metaphysicians of the last century.",133.0,Education,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=jbWoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=50&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jbWoEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jbWoEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jbWoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It provides an introduction to some of Levinas's major themes of ethics, justice, hope, hospitality, forgiveness and more, as its contributing authors address some fundamental educational issues such as: what it means to be a teacher; what it means to learn from a teacher; the role of language in the curriculum; literature, ethics, and education; moral education and human relations in schools; ethics of responsibility and philosophical-pedagogical discourse; educational hospitality and interculturalism; unconditional responsibility and education; educating for participatory democratic citizenship; the pedagogy of peace; logic, rationality, and ethics; connecting teaching to spirituality. Levinas always insisted that his aim was not to provide ""a program,"" and accordingly, it is not the intent of the authors to look in Levinas's texts for a set of guidelines, rules, or precepts to be applied to education. Rather, this study invites educators, and researchers in philosophy and philosophy of education, to a thoughtful and critical reading of Levinas, and to engage with his unique style of analysis and questioning as they uncover with these authors the necessity and the possibility of thinking education anew in terms of ethics, justice, responsibility, hope and faith.",548.0,Education,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=igCTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=82&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=igCTAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-igCTAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=igCTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1900 edition. Excerpt: ... Ill WASTE IN EDUCATION The subject announced for today was ""Waste in Education."" I should like first to state briefly its relation to the two preceding lectures. The first dealt with the school in its social aspects, and the necessary re-adjustments that have to be made to render it effective in present social conditions. The second dealt with the school in relation to the growth of individual children. Now the third deals with the school as itself an institution, both in relation to society and to its own members -- the children. It deals with the question of organization, because all waste is the result of the lack of it, the motive lying behind organization being promotion of economy and efficiency. This question is not one of the waste of money or the waste of things. These matters count; but the primary waste is that of human life, the life of the children while they are at school, and afterward because of inadequate and perverted preparation. So, when we speak of organization, we are not to think simply of the externals; of that which goes by the name ""school system ""--the school board, the superintendent, and the building, the 77 engaging and promotion of teachers, etc. These things enter in, but the fundamental organization is that of the school itself as a community of individuals, in its relations to other forms of social life. All waste is due to isolation. Organization is nothing but getting things into connection with one another, so that they work easily, flexibly, and fully. Therefore in speaking of this question of waste in education, I desire to call your attention to the isolation of the various parts of the school system, to the lack of unity in the aims of education, to the lack of coherence in its studies and...",24.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=DDAongEACAAJ&dq=subject:Education&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=121&source=gbs_api,,Education,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DDAongEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Is this because we are in a time of textual change? Given that young people always seem to be in the vanguard of technological change, questions about what and how they read are the subject of intense debate. Children as Readers in Children’s Literature explores these questions by looking at the literature that is written for children and young people to see what it tells us about them as readers. The contributors to this book are a group of distinguished children’s literature scholars, literacy and media specialists who contemplate the multiple images of children as readers and how they reflect the power and purpose of texts and literacy. Contributors to this wide-ranging text consider: How books shape the readers we become Cognitive and affective responses to representation of books and reading The relationship between love-stories and reading as a cultural activity Reading as ‘Protection and Enlightenment’ Picturebooks as stage sets for acts of reading Readers’ perceptions of a writer This portrayal of books and reading also reveals adults’ beliefs about childhood and literacy and how they are changing.

TX5KCAAAQBAJ,Justice in Young Adult Speculative Fiction,A Cognitive Reading,Marek C. Oziewicz,Routledge,2015-04-17,"This book is the first to offer a justice-focused cognitive reading of modern YA speculative fiction in its narrative and filmic forms. It links the expansion of YA speculative fiction in the 20th century with the emergence of human and civil rights movements, with the communitarian revolution in conceptualizations of justice, and with spectacular advances in cognitive sciences as applied to the examination of narrative fiction. Oziewicz argues that complex ideas such as justice are processed by the human mind as cognitive scripts; that scripts, when narrated, take the form of multiply indexable stories; and that YA speculative fiction is currently the largest conceptual testing ground in the forging of justice consciousness for the 21st century world. Drawing on recent research in the cognitive and evolutionary sciences, Oziewicz explains how poetic, retributive, restorative, environmental, social, and global types of justice have been represented in narrative fiction, from 19th century folk and fairy tales through 21st century fantasy, dystopia, and science fiction. Suggesting that the appeal of these and other nonmimetic genres is largely predicated on the dream of justice, Oziewicz theorizes new justice scripts as conceptual tools essential to help humanity survive the qualitative leap toward an environmentally conscious, culturally diversified global world. This book is an important contribution to studies of children’s and YA speculative fiction, adding a new perspective to discussions about the educational as well as social potential of nonmimetic genres. It demonstrates that the justice imperative is very much alive in YA speculative fiction, creating new visions of justice relevant to contemporary challenges.",246.0,Literary Criticism,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=TX5KCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1991&dq=subject:Science+Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TX5KCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TX5KCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Science Fiction & Fantasy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TX5KCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
tNe-EAAAQBAJ,(Eco)Anxiety in Nuclear Holocaust Fiction and Climate Fiction,Doomsday Clock Narratives,Dominika Oramus,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-07,"(Eco)Anxiety in Nuclear Holocaust Fiction and Climate Fiction: Doomsday Clock Narratives demonstrates that disaster fiction— nuclear holocaust and climate change alike— allows us to unearth and anatomise contemporary psychodynamics and enables us to identify pretraumatic stress as the common denominator of seemingly unrelated types of texts. These Doomsday Clock Narratives argue that earth’s demise is soon and certain. They are set after some catastrophe and depict people waiting for an even worse catastrophe to come. References to geology are particularly important— in descriptions of the landscape, the emphasis falls on waste and industrial bric- a- brac, which is seen through the eyes of a future, posthuman archaeologist. Their protagonists have the uncanny feeling that the countdown has already started, and they are coping with both traumatic memories and pretraumatic stress. Readings of novels by Walter M. Miller, Nevil Shute, John Christopher, J. G. Ballard, George Turner, Maggie Gee, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ruth Ozeki, and Yoko Tawada demonstrate that the authors are both indebted to a century- old tradition and inventively looking for new ways of expressing the pretraumatic stress syndrome common in contemporary society.

CNUiEAAAQBAJ,Ecofeminist Science Fiction,"International Perspectives on Gender, Ecology, and Literature",Douglas A. Vakoch,Routledge,2021-04-29,"Ecofeminist Science Fiction: International Perspectives on Gender, Ecology, and Literature provides guidance in navigating some of the most pressing dangers we face today. Science fiction helps us face problems that threaten the very existence of humankind by giving us the emotional distance to see our current situation from afar, separated in our imaginations through time, space, or circumstance. Extrapolating from contemporary science, science fiction allows a critique of modern society, imagining more life-affirming alternatives. In this collection, ecocritics from five continents scrutinize science fiction for insights into the fundamental changes we need to make to survive and thrive as a species. Contributors examine ecofeminist themes in films, such as Avatar, Star Wars, and The Stepford Wives, as well as television series including Doctor Who and Westworld. Other scholars explore an internationally diverse group of both canonical and lesser-known science fiction writers including Oreet Ashery, Iraj Fazel Bakhsheshi, Liu Cixin, Louise Erdrich, Hanns Heinz Ewers, Larissa Lai, Ursula K. Le Guin, Chen Qiufan, Mary Doria Russell, Larissa Sansour, Karen Traviss, and Jeanette Winterson. Ecofeminist Science Fiction explores the origins of human-caused environmental change in the twin oppressions of women and of nature, driven by patriarchal power and ideologies. Female embodiment is examined through diverse natural and artificial forms, and queer ecologies challenge heteronormativity. The links between war and environmental destruction are analyzed, and the capitalist motivations and means for exploiting nature are critiqued through postcolonial perspectives.",163.0,Fiction,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=CNUiEAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PT42&dq=subject:Science+Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=10&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CNUiEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CNUiEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Science Fiction & Fantasy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CNUiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Thirty-six contributions approach the theme from the fields of philosophy, linguistics, literature and art, and natural science. The discussion is of the fundamental questions of whether a possible world created by art can be an instrument for understanding the actual world and, conversely whether scientific theories and models can be regarded as fictional in some way.

y7vnDQAAQBAJ,Blockbuster Science,The Real Science in Science Fiction,David Siegel Bernstein,Prometheus Books,2017-10-10,"If you've ever wondered how much real science goes into movies like Gravity, novels like The Martian, and television shows like Doctor Who, this is the book for you. Written by an author who is both a data scientist and a science fiction writer, this entertaining and accessible book uses popular science fiction movies, stories, and TV shows to explain the science behind popular narrative concepts like time travel, lightsabers, AI, genetic mutation, asteroids, cyborgs, black holes, alien invasion, the zombie apocalypse, and more. What could be a more fun way to explore the world of science than through its use—accurately or fantastically—in science fiction entertainment: movies, books, and TV shows? Learn about relativity through Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and the movie Interstellar; black holes and wormholes in connection with Contact and Planet of the Apes; theories about the origin of life as reflected in Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; computer science and artificial intelligence in reference to A.I. Artificial Intelligence; and much, much, more. Written with wit, clarity, and a great sense of fun, Blockbuster Science will inspire science fiction fans to get excited about real science while also putting an engaging pop culture spin on science for any curious reader.",338.0,Science,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=y7vnDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&dq=subject:Science+Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=124&source=gbs_api,,Science Fiction & Fantasy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7vnDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

OQRBAQAAMAAJ,Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought,,Herbert George Wells,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,1902,"It is proposed in this book to present in as orderly an arrangement as the necessarily diffused nature of the subject admits, certain speculations about the trend of present forces, speculations which, taken all together, will build up an imperfect and very hypothetical, but sincerely intended forecast of the way things will probably go in this new century. Necessarily diffidence will be one of the graces of the performance. Hitherto such forecasts have been presented almost invariably in the form of fiction, and commonly the provocation of the satirical opportunity has been too much for the writer; the narrative form becomes more and more of a nuisance as the speculative inductions become sincerer, and here it will be abandoned altogether in favour of a texture of frank inquiries and arranged considerations. Our utmost aim is a rough sketch of the coming time, a prospectus, as it were, of the joint undertaking of mankind in facing these impending years. The reader is a prospective shareholder-he and his heirs-though whether he will find this anticipatory balance-sheet to his belief or liking is another matter. For reasons that will develop themselves more clearly as these papers unfold, it is extremely convenient to begin with a speculation upon the probable developments and changes of the means of land locomotion during the coming decades.",344.0,History,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=OQRBAQAAMAAJ&q=subject:Science+Fiction&dq=subject:Science+Fiction&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=170&source=gbs_api,,Science Fiction & Fantasy,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OQRBAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

qT-5MLRkHBAC,The Emperor of All Maladies,A Biography of Cancer,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Simon and Schuster,2010-11-16,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a documentary from Ken Burns on PBS, this New York Times bestseller is “an extraordinary achievement” (The New Yorker)—a magnificent, profoundly humane “biography” of cancer—from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Now includes an excerpt from Siddhartha Mukherjee’s new book Song of the Cell! Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist’s precision, a historian’s perspective, and a biographer’s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with—and perished from—for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.",624.0,Medical,en,5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=qT-5MLRkHBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Medical&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=2&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qT-5MLRkHBAC&rdid=book-qT-5MLRkHBAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Medical,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qT-5MLRkHBAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Goldstein has crafted a briefer, easier-to-understand, and more student-friendly book, without sacrificing the text's comprehensive examination of sensation and perception. Goldstein takes readers on an intriguing journey through their senses, and chronicles scientists' efforts to understand the fascinating behind-the-scenes activity that allows us to perceive. With balanced coverage of all the senses, this book offers an integrated examination of how the senses work together. Goldstein shows readers how seemingly simple experiences are actually extremely complex mechanisms and examines both the psychophysical and physiological underpinnings of perception. All material is presented in a way students find interesting and easy to follow. The book's visually dynamic presentation includes numerous color plates that are presented as visual topic essays. In addition, more than 50 hands-on demonstrations illustrate perceptual experiences.

RgXo1E6tWxAC,British Romanticism and the Science of the Mind,,Alan Richardson,Cambridge University Press,2001-07-26,"In this provocative and original study, Alan Richardson examines an entire range of intellectual, cultural, and ideological points of contact between British Romantic literary writing and the pioneering brain science of the time. Richardson breaks new ground in two fields, revealing a significant and undervalued facet of British Romanticism while demonstrating the 'Romantic' character of early neuroscience. Crucial notions like the active mind, organicism, the unconscious, the fragmented subject, instinct and intuition, arising simultaneously within the literature and psychology of the era, take on unsuspected valences that transform conventional accounts of Romantic cultural history. Neglected issues like the corporeality of mind, the role of non-linguistic communication, and the peculiarly Romantic understanding of cultural universals are reopened in discussions that bring new light to bear on long-standing critical puzzles, from Coleridge's suppression of 'Kubla Khan', to Wordsworth's perplexing theory of poetic language, to Austen's interest in head injury.",270.0,Literary Criticism,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=RgXo1E6tWxAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Medical&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=6&source=gbs_api,,Medical,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RgXo1E6tWxAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It has become impossible for all to have the time and resources to find, appraise and interpret this evidence and incorporate it into healthcare decisions. Cochrane Reviews respond to this challenge by identifying, appraising and synthesizing research-based evidence and presenting it in a standardized format, published in The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions contains methodological guidance for the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane intervention reviews. Written in a clear and accessible format, it is the essential manual for all those preparing, maintaining and reading Cochrane reviews. Many of the principles and methods described here are appropriate for systematic reviews applied to other types of research and to systematic reviews of interventions undertaken by others.

They are the oldest forms of life as we know it, and they are still the most prolific living organisms. They inhabit every part of the Earth's surface, its ocean depths, and even terrains such as boiling hot springs. They are most familiar as agents of disease, but benign bacteria are critical to the recycling of elements and all ecology, as well as to human health.

Rooted in the social history of the care of the elderly and terminally ill, Modern Hospice Design: The Architecture of Palliative and Social Care takes cognisance of the new conditions of social care in the 21st century, principally in the UK, Europe and North America. It does so with regard to the development of new building types, but also in response to new philosophies of palliative care and the status of the elderly and the dying. Benefitting from a clearer methodological approach and conceptual framework, the expanded book allows a broad section of readers to navigate the text more easily. At its core is a public discussion of a philosophy of design for providing care for the elderly and the vulnerable, taking the importance of architectural aesthetics, the use of quality materials, the porousness of design to the wider world, and the integration of indoor and outdoor spaces as part of the overall care environment. In doing so it advocates care settings that, in the words of Maggie Jencks whose life and ideas inspired the Maggie’s Centres, ‘rise to the occasion’.

The range of pathological abnormality is described and its relevance discussed. Attention is drawn to the differences in pathological findings in specific conditions between the second and third trimester. The second part of the book is system orientated and describes and illustrates those pathological problems which are likely to be encountered in the fetus and neonate. Each chapter is introduced by a concise account of the development of that system. Where relevant there is also discussion of changes at birth as well as changes in normal function that may occur during the neonatal period. Fetal and Neonatal Pathology is primarily written for the morbid anatomist and histopathologist. It also provides a valuable source of reference for obstetricians, neonatologists and paediatricians.

Over centuries, women's bodies have been demonised and demeaned until we feared them, felt ashamed of them, were humiliated by them. But as doctors, researchers, campaigners and most of all as patients, women have continuously challenged medical orthodoxy. Medicine's history has always been, and is still being, rewritten by women's resistance, strength and incredible courage. In this ground-breaking history Elinor Cleghorn unpacks the roots of the perpetual misunderstanding, mystification and misdiagnosis of women's bodies, illness and pain. From the 'wandering womb' of ancient Greece to today's shifting understanding of hormones, menstruation and menopause, Unwell Women is the revolutionary story of women who have suffered, challenged and rewritten medical misogyny.

It wasn’t enough that I stopped drinking. I had to learn how to live.” The journey from alcoholic insanity to sobriety—and the pivotal role of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in navigating that transition—is the focus of Last Call. Using powerful first-person narratives like the one above (composites of many anonymous speakers), psychotherapist Jack H. Hedblom provides compelling insights into the minds and hearts of addicted drinkers, from bizarre behavior and denial to the moment of “hitting bottom” and seeking change. Hedblom covers the process of getting sober, from diagnosis to detox to sobriety. He focuses on the challenge of learning to live without drinking—a long-term goal, Hedblom asserts, that is best achieved by regular participation in AA. Hedblom’s vivid descriptions reveal AA meetings as gatherings of fellowship, compassion, tears, and laughter. In relating the history of the organization, he describes the role of sponsors, elaborates on the Twelve Steps and the Promises, emphasizes the importance of spiritual development in recovery, and refutes the common misconceptions that equate spirituality with organized religion. Through the stories of people who have escaped the tyranny of alcoholism with the help of AA, Hedblom shows that the road to recovery is a journey of self-discovery, change, and hope.",222.0,Psychology,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=noL8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Medical&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=122&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=noL8EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-noL8EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Medical,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=noL8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

KM50DwAAQBAJ,Nourishment,What Animals Can Teach Us about Rediscovering Our Nutritional Wisdom,Fred Provenza,Chelsea Green Publishing,2018,"Reflections on feeding body and spirit in a world of change Animal scientists have long considered domestic livestock to be too dumb to know how to eat right, but the lifetime research of animal behaviorist Fred Provenza and his colleagues has debunked this myth. Their work shows that when given a choice of natural foods, livestock have an astoundingly refined palate, nibbling through the day on as many as fifty kinds of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to meet their nutritional needs with remarkable precision. In Nourishment Provenza presents his thesis of the wisdom body, a wisdom that links flavor-feedback relationships at a cellular level with biochemically rich foods to meet the body's nutritional and medicinal needs. Provenza explores the fascinating complexity of these relationships as he raises and answers thought-provoking questions about what we can learn from animals about nutritional wisdom. What kinds of memories form the basis for how herbivores, and humans, recognize foods? Can a body develop nutritional and medicinal memories in utero and early in life? Do humans still possess the wisdom to select nourishing diets? Or, has that ability been hijacked by nutritional ""authorities""? Consumers eager for a ""quick fix"" have empowered the multibillion-dollar-a-year supplement industry, but is taking supplements and enriching and fortifying foods helping us, or is it hurting us? On a broader scale Provenza explores the relationships among facets of complex, poorly understood, ever-changing ecological, social, and economic systems in light of an unpredictable future. To what degree do we lose contact with life-sustaining energies when the foods we eat come from anywhere but where we live? To what degree do we lose the mythological relationship that links us physically and spiritually with Mother Earth who nurtures our lives? Provenza's paradigm-changing exploration of these questions has implications that could vastly improve our health through a simple change in the way we view our relationships with the plants and animals we eat. Our health could be improved by eating biochemically rich foods and by creating cultures that know how to combine foods into meals that nourish and satiate. Provenza contends the voices of ""authority"" disconnect most people from a personal search to discover the inner wisdom that can nourish body and spirit. That journey means embracing wonder and uncertainty and avoiding illusions of stability and control as we dine on a planet in a universe bent on consuming itself.",417.0,Health & Fitness,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Medical&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=169&source=gbs_api,,Medical,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

nnKdEAAAQBAJ,The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (The Complete Edition),With Illustrations,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,DigiCat,2022-11-13,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge's ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (The Complete Edition)"" stands as a seminal work in the Romantic literary canon, encapsulating the interplay between nature, the supernatural, and human experience. Through its intricate narrative structure and rich, evocative language, the poem unfolds the harrowing journey of the Mariner, whose cursed voyage becomes an exploration of guilt, redemption, and the interconnectedness of all living things. Coleridge's innovative use of meter and rhyme enhances the poem's haunting atmosphere, while its allegorical depth invites multiple interpretations, engaging themes of faith, nature, and moral consequence. Coleridge, a pivotal figure in the Romantic movement, was deeply influenced by his own philosophical inquiries and experiences with nature, as well as his fascination with gothic and supernatural elements. His collaboration with fellow poet William Wordsworth and their shared focus on individualism and emotional authenticity shaped not only Coleridge's poetic style but also his thematic preoccupations. The Ancient Mariner, written under the shadows of personal struggles with addiction and despondency, thus reflects not only his artistic vision but also his quest for deeper understanding of human nature and the cosmos. This complete edition of ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" is a must-read for anyone seeking to delve into the intricacies of Romantic poetry and the broader implications of human existence. Coleridge's masterpiece not only captures the imagination with its vivid imagery and haunting narrative but also provokes profound contemplation on the relationship between humanity and the natural world. Engaging with this enduring text offers readers both a gripping story and a timeless meditation on morality, nature, and the human condition.",94.0,Poetry,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=nnKdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Poetry&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnKdEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nnKdEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Poetry,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nnKdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
lPhHFJavH8sC,Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School,"Keats, Shelley, Hunt and Their Circle",Jeffrey N. Cox,Cambridge University Press,2004-05-20,"Jeffrey N. Cox refines our conception of 'second generation' Romanticism by placing it within the circle of writers around Leigh Hunt that came to be known as the 'Cockney School'. Offering a theory of the group as a key site for cultural production, Cox challenges the traditional image of the Romantic poet as an isolated figure by recreating the social nature of the work of Shelley, Keats, Hunt, Hazlitt, Byron, and others, as they engaged in literary contests, wrote poems celebrating one another, and worked collaboratively on journals and other projects. Cox also recovers the work of neglected writers such as John Hamilton Reynolds, Horace Smith, and Cornelius Webb as part of the rich social and cultural context of Hunt's circle. This book not only demonstrates convincingly that a 'Cockney School' existed, but shows that it was committed to putting literature in the service of social, cultural, and political reform.",304.0,Literary Criticism,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=lPhHFJavH8sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Poetry&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api,,Poetry,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lPhHFJavH8sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

BGjKrQEACAAJ,The Flowers of Evil,,"Charles Baudelaire, John Tidball",CreateSpace,2014-11-22,"This book contains a completely new translation of the full text of the 1861 edition, completed in 2014. It has nothing to do with the reprints of an old public domain translation from 1909, with which it has been linked here. This new English verse translation, with footnotes, is followed by the original French text. The six poems which were banned in 1857 are also included. Charles Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du Mal' marked an important turning point in the history of world poetry, providing a crucial link between romanticism and modernism. The first one hundred and twenty-six poems in this book are as they appeared in the 1861 edition. These are followed by the six poems which were censored from the original edition of 1857. This brand new translation, completed in 2014, preserves the metre and rhyme scheme of each original poem. Some of the poems are very beautiful, while others are not for the faint-hearted. Taken as a whole, they convey the 'spleen' or 'ennui' which Baudelaire felt so keenly, a state of mind that echoes the 'mal du siecle' of early 19th century France.""",342.0,Poetry,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=BGjKrQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Poetry&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=42&source=gbs_api,,Poetry,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BGjKrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide.

6qTbxQEACAAJ,The Madman,His Parables and Poems,Kahlil Gibran,Indoeuropeanpublishing.com,2019-05-27,"Khalil Gibran (January 6, 1883 - April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese-American writer, poet, visual artist and Lebanese nationalist. Though born a Maronite, Gibran was influenced not only by his own religion but also by Islam, and especially by the mysticism of the Sufis. His knowledge of Lebanon's bloody history, with its destructive factional struggles, strengthened his belief in the fundamental unity of religions, which his parents exemplified by welcoming people of various religions in their home. Connections and parallels have also been made to William Blake's work, as well as the theological ideas of Walt Whitman and in Ralph Waldo Emerson such as reincarnation and the Over-soul. Themes of influence in his work were Islamic/Arabic art, European Classicism (particularly Leonardo Da Vinci) and Romanticism (Blake and Auguste Rodin), the pre-Raphelite Brotherhood, and more modern symbolism and surrealism. Gibran had a number of strong connections to the Bahá'í Faith starting around 1912. One of Gibran's acquaintances, Juliet Thompson, reported several anecdotes relating to Gibran. She recalled Gibran had met 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the leader of the religion at the time of his journeys to the West Gibran was unable to sleep the night before meeting him in person to draw his portrait in April 1912 on the island of Manhattan. Gibran later told Thompson that in 'Abdu'l-Bahá he had ""seen the Unseen, and been filled"". Gibran began work on the book The Prophet, in 1912 when ""he got the first motif, for his Island God"" whose 'Prometheus exile shall be an Island one.""In 1928, after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, at a viewing of a movie of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of `Abdu'l-Bahá and left the event weeping still.

4nmPzQEACAAJ,Othello,Large Print,William Shakespeare,,2020-05-19,"Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine-differences of race, of age, of cultural background-that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination-which dominates the early acts of the play-turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.Iago is furious about being overlooked for promotion and plots to take revenge against his General; Othello, the Moor of Venice. Iago manipulates Othello into believing his wife Desdemona is unfaithful, stirring Othello's jealousy. Othello allows jealousy to consume him, murders Desdemona, and then kills himself.Venice.

The old theory as to the nature of the Chinese written character (which Pound and Fenollosa followed) is that the written character is ideogrammic-a stylized picture of the thing or concept it represents. The opposing theory (which prevails today among scholars) is that the character may have had pictorial origins in prehistoric times but that these origins have been obscured in all but a few very simple cases, and that in any case native writers don't have the original pictorial meaning in mind as they write. Whether Pound proceeded on false premises remains an academic question. Let the pedants rave.

In the spring of 1919, two young men, André Breton and Philippe Soupault, both in a state of shock after World War I, embarked on an experiment. Sick of the literary cultivation of “voice,” sick of the “well-written,” they wanted to unleash the power of the word and to create “a new morality” to replace “the prevailing morality, the source of all our trials and tribulations.” They had a plan. They would write for a week on every day of the week and they would write fast, as fast as possible, in complete secrecy. When the week was over, the writing would be done. No touching up. This was how The Magnetic Fields, the first sustained exercise in automatic writing, came to be.

hVX9sgEACAAJ,Letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero,With His Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (Classic Reprint),Marcus Tullius Cicero,,2015-07-03,"Excerpt from Letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero: With His Treatises on Friendship and Old Age Marcus Tullius Cicero, the greatest of Roman orators and the chief master of Latin prose style, was born at Arpinum, Jan. 3,106 B. C. His father, who was a man of property and belonged to the class of the ""Knights,"" moved to Rome when Cicero was a child; and the future statesman received an elaborate education in rhetoric, law, and philosophy, studying and practising under some of the most noted teachers of the time. He began his career as an advocate at the age of twenty-five, and almost immediately came to be recognised not only as a man of brilliant talents but also as a courageous upholder of justice in the face of grave political danger. After two years of practice he left Rome to travel in Greece and Asia, taking all the opportunities that offered to study his art under distinguished masters. He returned to Rome greatly improved in health and in professional skill, and in 76 B. C. was elected to the office of quaestor. He was assigned to the province of Lilybaeum in Sicily, and the vigor and justice of his administration earned him the gratitude of the inhabitants. It was at their request that he undertook in 70 B. C. the prosecution of Verres, who as praetor had subjected the Sicilians to incredible extortion and oppression; and his successful conduct of this case, which ended in the conviction and banishment of Verres, may be said to have launched him on his political career. He became aedile in the same year, in 67 B. C. praetor, and in 64 B. C. was elected consul by a large majority. The most important event of the year of his consulship was the conspiracy of Catiline. This notorious criminal of patrician rank had conspired with a number of others, many of them young men of high birth but dissipated character, to seize the chief offices of the state, and to extricate themselves from the pecuniary and other difficulties that had resulted from their excesses, by the wholesale plunder of the city. The plot was unmasked by the vigilance of Cicero, five of the traitors were summarily executed, and in the overthrow of the army that had been gathered in their support Catiline himself perished. Cicero regarded himself as the savior of his country, and his country for the moment seemed to give grateful assent. But reverses were at hand.

JwVzEAAAQBAJ,A Doll's House,,Henrik Ibsen,DigiCat,2022-05-28,"In Henrik Ibsen's groundbreaking three-act play 'A Doll's House,' the audience is presented with a narrative that starkly challenges the societal norms of 19th century Norway, particularly in regards to gender roles and marriage conventions. Through its candid dialogue and realist characterization, the play artfully constructs the life of Nora Helmer, who evolves from a seemingly naive and subservient wife into a woman determined to find her own identity. Its literary style is steeped in the naturalist movement, painting an unvarnished picture of domestic life, and pushing the boundaries of theatrical art to address hidden social issues. Ibsen's crafting of 'A Doll's House' extends beyond mere storytelling; it is a carefully structured commentary that has laid the groundwork for modern realistic drama.nnHenrik Ibsen himself was a literary pioneer whose works were often controversial for their time because they dissected the foundational institutions of society, such as marriage, family, and morality. Perhaps inspired by the changing tides of the socio-political landscape in Europe or by his own observations of the rigid confines of society, Ibsen produced in 'A Doll's House' a play that, while denied a feminist manifesto, unmistakably advocates for individual freedom and criticizes the hypocritical fabric of Victorian marriage.nn'A Doll's House' is recommended not only for students of literature but also for those interested in the exploration of human rights and gender equality. The play's historical significance, intricate character development, and its potent blend of controversy and critical discourse render it an essential read. The journey of Nora Helmer speaks profoundly to the ongoing discussion of personal autonomy and societal expectations. For those captivated by the transformation of characters and the breakdown of societal facades, 'A Doll's House' holds a mirror up to the audience, challenging them to consider the mechanisms of their own lives.",88.0,Drama,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=JwVzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Drama&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api,,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JwVzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Mhw0mAEACAAJ,Peer Gynt,,Henrik Ibsen,Digireads.com Publishing,2010-01-01,"Born in Skien, Norway in 1828, Henrik Ibsen has often been referred to as the founder of modern drama and modernism in theatre. Ibsen was widely known as an atheist and political radical, and channeled some of those sentiments into his works. ""Peer Gynt"" captures humankind's unsure, imperfect and opportunistic nature in many memorable scenes: a portrait so intimate and accurate that the play has become a classic in Norwegian literature. This five act play was based on the Norwegian fairy tale, ""Per Gynt,"" and broke down the structural barriers of Norwegian theatre, as Ibsen wrote the entire play in verse-form. ""Peer Gynt"" drifts between the conscious and unconscious, blending realism and folkloric fantasy. Ibsen used this play to satirize transcendentalist ideas, new and revolutionary at the time, that encouraged a return to nature and simplicity. A year after finishing this work, Ibsen suffered his first severe stroke, and never wrote again. This play was incredibly controversial at the time it was written, and holds true to its evocative nature today.",98.0,Drama,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=Mhw0mAEACAAJ&dq=subject:Drama&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=85&source=gbs_api,,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mhw0mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Loosely based on the Odyssey, this landmark of modern literature follows ordinary Dubliners in 1904. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus, his wife Molly, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, Joyce pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. Captivating experimental techniques range from interior monologues to exuberant wordplay and earthy humor. A major achievement in 20th century literature. James Joyce, Irish novelist, noted for his experimental use of language in such works as Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Joyce's technical innovations in the art of the novel include an extensive use of interior monologue; he used a complex network of symbolic parallels drawn from the mythology, history, and literature, and created a unique language of invented words, puns, and allusions.",102.0,,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=MZQKzgEACAAJ&dq=subject:Drama&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=88&source=gbs_api,,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MZQKzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
AFmZtwEACAAJ,Man and Superman: A Comedy and a Philosophy (Classic Reprint),,Bernard Shaw,Forgotten Books,2018-04-23,"Man and Superman: A Comedy and a Philosophy is a dramatic work penned by George Bernard Shaw and originally performed at The Royal Court Theatre in London in 1905. George Bernard Shaw was a well-known Irish author, playwright and journalist. He holds the distinction of being the only individual ever to win both an Academy Award and the Nobel Prize for Literature. Man and Superman is one of his most well known dramatic works. The story is a classic 'Don Juan' story, the fictional libertine and womaniser who is the central character in many dramatic works. Told over four acts, it is the story of John Tanner, a revolutionary, and his pursuit of the beautiful Ann Whitefield. A lengthy epistle dedicatory in which the author explains the genesis of the work precedes the play. The book concludes with The Revolutionist's Handbook, presented as the work of Shaw's central character John Tanner. Man and Superman, as the subtitle suggests, is intended to be both a comedic work and a commentary on gender relations. Shaw believes that women hold more social power than men, particularly with regards to decisions of marriage. The drama itself is indeed quite comical, and it becomes clear to the reader why this work achieved a good deal of popularity in its day. George Bernard Shaw was an accomplished artist, and Man and Superman is one of his most renowned works. Fans of Shaw will certainly be pleased with this title, which can also serve as the perfect introduction to the author's works for the uninitiated.

Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland (Götaland in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory. The main protagonist Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair. Later in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a dragon, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at Earnanæs, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf, whose name means ""remnant of valour"",[a] dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honor.

The play tells in one act the Biblical story of Salome, stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas, who, to her stepfather's dismay but to the delight of her mother Herodias, requests the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the dance of the seven veils.Salomé has made the author's name a household word wherever the English language is not spoken. Few plays have such a peculiar history. Before tracing briefly the vicissitudes of a work that has been more execrated than even its author, I venture to repeat the corrections which I communicated to the Morning Post when the opera of Dr. Strauss was produced in a mutilated verson at Covent Garden in December, 1910. That such reiteration is necessary is illustrated by the circumstance that a musical critic in the Academy of December 17th, 1910, wrote of Wilde's ""imaginative verses"" apropos of Salomé - a strange comment on the honesty of musical criticism.

There is probably no good school, public or private, in England in which a play of Shakespeare or a book of the Faerie Queene or of Paradise Lost is not included in the curriculum, and generally no doubt with the happiest results. In some cases such studies, degenerating into cram-work, may have failed to effect what it was hoped they would effect, but as a rule their record has certainly not been failure. An intelligent appreciation of good literature and a genuine interest in it have been created; liberal curiosity has been awakened, and very many boys and girls annually leave our schools both fitted and anxious to extend their reading and explore for themselves the authors to whom they have been introduced.

HD2BuQAACAAJ,The Jungle Book,,Rudyard Kipling,Oberon Books,2011-10-18,"From a version by Tim Supple From the novel by Rudyard Kipling Mowgli was still a toddler when he was lost in the jungle – his parents feeing the tiger, Shere Khan. There, Mowgli was brought up by wolves, and educated by the bear Baloo and the panther Bagheera.He was happy while growing up and learning the ways of the jungle –and his name was soon known amongst all the animals. But Mowgli’sgrowing fame provoked resentment and envy, and his life was soon threatened from all sides... First published in the late 1890s, Rudyard Kipling’s two Jungle Books have enchanted generations of children and adults. Often describedas an allegory for the society and politics of the time, The Jungle Book has now been adapted by critically-acclaimed South African playwright, Craig Higginson. The play asks: Who is your family? Those who look the same as you or those who love and nurture you? Here, the tales become a powerful examination of an emerging democracy, and the forces that threaten it. Based on a version by the celebrated director Tim Supple, this adaptation was first staged at Johannesburg’s Market Theatre in 2008. This powerful and magical version of a much-loved classic is as resonant now as it was when it first appeared – both within South Africa and beyond its borders.",64.0,Drama,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=HD2BuQAACAAJ&dq=subject:Drama&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=129&source=gbs_api,,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HD2BuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Controlling Accounts.--The addition of special columns in books of original entry makes possible the keeping of Controlling Accounts. The most common examples of such accounts are Accounts Receivable account and Accounts Payable account. These summary accounts, respectively, displace individual customers' and creditors' accounts in the Ledger. The customers' accounts are then segregated in another book called the Sales Ledger or Customers' Ledger, while the creditors' accounts are kept in the Purchase or Creditors' Ledger. The original Ledger, now much reduced in size, is called the General Ledger. The Trial Balance now refers to the accounts in the General Ledger. It is evident that the task of taking a Trial Balance is greatly simplified because so many fewer accounts are involved. A Schedule of Accounts Receivable is then prepared, consisting of the balances found in the Sales Ledger, and its total must agree with the balance of the Accounts Receivable account shown in the Trial Balance. A similar Schedule of Accounts Payable, made up of all the balances in the Purchase Ledger, is prepared, and it must agree with the balance of the Accounts Payable account of the General Ledger.""

pbvSl2LF2_4C,Lady Windermere's Fan - A Play about a Good Woman,,Oscar Wilde,Hazen Press,2009-05,"INTRODUCTION The early Chinese believed that jade had an immortality of its own and was impervious to decay. For them there was no substance nobler, purer, more durable, more pre-eminently suitable for the fashioning of religious emblems and the embodiment of dogma. Round jade, as round a kernel, the whole body of early Chinese civilisation crystallised. And yet they were not the first discoverers or users of jade, for the Babylonians made seal cylinders of jade, and Professor Elliott Smith believes that the Turkestan jade mountains and rivers were first worked by miners from Mesopotamia who, passing on legends about the magical qualities of jade, infected the Chinese with their beliefs. From the third millennium he says, the mines on the S.E. of the Caspian were being exploited and contact was established between Babylonians, Elamites, and the population of Turkestan. But however early the contacts, assumed or established, we can state truthfully that the Chinese made jade particularly and everlastingly their own, embodying in it their traditions, their religion, their administrative system. They may have derived their belief in the life-giving properties of jade from the Elamites, or have come to attach a magical value to its presence from the Babylonian miners, but for neither of these peoples was it the vehicle of supernatural beliefs, and, penetrate as far back as we may into pre-history, we cannot find a time in China in which jade was not used for religious purposes. What perhaps emphasises the peculiar position of jade in Chinese culture is the fact that other early peoples used jade, although for them it had no significance greater or even as great as gold or pearls. Jade was dug and worked in many parts of Europe. Hatchets have been found in Switzerland, nephrite celts in South Italy and France, Germany, Dalmatia, and Hungary. Jade celts, too, were discovered by Schliemann at Hissarlik, but by no people save the Chinese has jade been made the nucleus and the shrine of a civilisation-although its use was distributed in Turkestan, Persia, Siberia, India, Lake Baikal, and Japan, and to a minor degree the substance was prized by most Asiatic peoples. It is only during the last two decades that collectors have begun to realise the enormous importance of jade. Dr. Laufer broke new ground when, in 1912, he published his great work, xde, A Study in Chinese Archzology and Religion. His object in writing this book was rather ethnological than artistic. He himself calls it a contribution to the l Anthropology, Encyclopzdia Britannica.....",148.0,Drama,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=pbvSl2LF2_4C&dq=subject:Drama&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=162&source=gbs_api,,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pbvSl2LF2_4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Titus, a model Roman, has led twenty-one of his twenty-five sons to death in Rome's wars; he stabs another son to death for what he views as disloyalty to Rome.

After a death sentence is imposed on two of his three remaining sons, and his daughter is raped and mutilated, Titus turns his loyalty toward his family. Aaron the Moor, a magnificent villain and the empress's secret lover, makes a similar transition. After the empress bears him a child, Aaron devotes himself to preserving the baby.

NaUkAQAAMAAJ,The Man who Planted Trees,,Jean Giono,,1989,"Jean Giono's beautiful allegorical tale is legendary. Written in the 1950's, its message was ahead of its time, inspiring readers to rediscoverthe harmonies of the countryside and prevent its willful destruction. The narrator, journeying by foot across the barren plains of the lower Alps, has his thirst assuaged by the well water drawn by the shepherd Elzeaerd Bouffier. Here begins the subtle parable which Giono weaves of the life-giving shepherd who chooses to live alone and carry out the work of God. Over forty years the desolate hills and lifeless villages which sooppressed the traveler are transformed by the dedication of one man. All with the help of a few acorns. Giono's hope was to set in motion a worldwide reforestation program that would rejuvenate the earth. ""The Man Who Planted Trees"" is a hymn to creation and a purveyor of confidence in man's ability to change his-indeed the world's-lot.

wnt0DwAAQBAJ,Natural Disasters,,David Alexander,Routledge,2018-10-24,"As a well balanced and fully illustrated introductory text, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the physical, technological and social components of natural disaster. The main disaster-producing agents are reviewed systematically in terms of geophysical processes and effects, monitoring, mitigation and warning. The relationship between disasters and society is examined with respect to a wide variety of themes, including damage assessment and prevention, hazard mapping, emergency preparedness, the provision of shelter and the nature of reconstruction. Medical emergencies and the epidemiology of disasters are described, and refugee management and aid to the Third World are discussed. A chapter is devoted to the sociology, psychology, economics and history of disasters.; In many parts of the world the toll of death, injury, damage and deprivation caused by natural disasters is becoming increasingly serious. Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods and other similar catastrophes are often followed by large relief operations characterized by substantial involvement of the international community. The years 1990-2000 have therefore been designated by the United Nations as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.; The book goes beyond mere description and elevates the field of natural catastrophes to a serious academic level. The author's insights and perspectives are also informed by his practical experience of being a disaster victim and survivor, and hence the unique perspective of a participant observer. Only by surmounting the boundaries between disciplines can natural catastrophe be understood and mitigation efforts made effective. Thus, this book is perhaps the first completely interdisciplinary, fully comprehensive survey of natural hazards and disasters. It has a clear theoretical basis and it recognizes the importance of six fundamental approaches to the field, which it blends carefully in the text in order to avoid the partiality of previous works. It covers the earth and social sciences, as well as engineering, architecture and development studies. This breadth is made possible by virtue of a strong emphasis on simple principles of the interaction of geophysical agents with human vulnerability and response.; All students of environmental sciences/studies and geography should find this book useful. It is an introductory text which treats this dramatic subject area as something demanding serious academic treatment and not just as an assemblage of horror stories.; This book is intended for undergraduate students in geography and environmental studies/sciences. The book should also appeal to any professional or researcher concerned with man- environment relations, whether in social science or natural science or engineering.",506.0,Nature,en,2.5,2.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=wnt0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api,,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wnt0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

1yqgBMhgaKMC,Animals and Women,Feminist Theoretical Explorations,"Carol J. Adams, Josephine Donovan",Duke University Press,1995-11-14,"Animals and Women is a collection of pioneering essays that explores the theoretical connections between feminism and animal defense. Offering a feminist perspective on the status of animals, this unique volume argues persuasively that both the social construction and oppressions of women are inextricably connected to the ways in which we comprehend and abuse other species. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such a focus does not distract from the struggle for women’s rights, but rather contributes to it. This wide-ranging multidisciplinary anthology presents original material from scholars in a variety of fields, as well as a rare, early article by Virginia Woolf. Exploring the leading edge of the species/gender boundary, it addresses such issues as the relationship between abortion rights and animal rights, the connection between woman-battering and animal abuse, and the speciesist basis for much sexist language. Also considered are the ways in which animals have been regarded by science, literature, and the environmentalist movement. A striking meditation on women and wolves is presented, as is an examination of sexual harassment and the taxonomy of hunters and hunting. Finally, this compelling collection suggests that the subordination and degradation of women is a prototype for other forms of abuse, and that to deny this connection is to participate in the continued mistreatment of animals and women.",394.0,Nature,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=1yqgBMhgaKMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=43&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1yqgBMhgaKMC&rdid=book-1yqgBMhgaKMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1yqgBMhgaKMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

xi4jcqyLk6kC,Giraffe,,Edgar Williams,Reaktion Books,2011-01-15,"Their extraordinary long necks, distinctive camouflage, graceful movements, and friendly nature have made giraffes one of the most fascinating and beloved animals on the planet. But while giraffes once roamed the Great Plains of Africa in huge herds, their numbers have greatly diminished, and they are now entirely dependent on humanity for their survival. In Giraffe, Edgar Williams explores not only the biology of the tallest animals on earth, but also their impact on human history—including in ancient Egypt, where giraffes were kept as exotic pets; the Middle Ages, when giraffes were considered mythical beasts as improbable and mysterious as the dragon; and the Victorian era, in which giraffe hunting was considered an exhilarating sport. Giraffe is the first book to provide a comprehensive, twenty-first-century view of the giraffe in art, literature, film, and popular culture, as well as its natural history from prehistory to modern times. With new insights into the giraffe’s genetics and evolution, this book will appeal to those interested in the giraffe’s unique biology and to anyone who admires the majestic giraffe.",177.0,Nature,en,4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=xi4jcqyLk6kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=49&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xi4jcqyLk6kC&rdid=book-xi4jcqyLk6kC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xi4jcqyLk6kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
mmPvf-l7xFEC,Analyzing Ecological Data,,"Alain Zuur, Elena N. Ieno, Graham M. Smith",Springer,2007-08-29,"'Which test should I apply?' During the many years of working with ecologists, biologists and other environmental scientists, this is probably the question that the authors of this book hear the most often. The answer is always the same and along the lines of 'What are your underlying questions?', 'What do you want to show?'. The answers to these questions provide the starting point for a detailed discussion on the ecological background and purpose of the study. This then gives the basis for deciding on the most appropriate analytical approach. Therefore, a better start ing point for an ecologist is to avoid the phrase 'test' and think in terms of 'analy sis'. A test refers to something simple and unified that gives a clear answer in the form of a p-value: something rarely appropriate for ecological data. In practice, one has to apply a data exploration, check assumptions, validate the models, per haps apply a series of methods, and most importantly, interpret the results in terms of the underlying ecology and the ecological questions being investigated. Ecology is a quantitative science trying to answer difficult questions about the complex world we live in. Most ecologists are aware of these complexities, but few are fully equipped with the statistical sophistication and understanding to deal with them.",686.0,Science,en,5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=mmPvf-l7xFEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=50&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mmPvf-l7xFEC&rdid=book-mmPvf-l7xFEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mmPvf-l7xFEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this enthralling book, Kathleen M. Dudzinski and Toni Frohoff take us into the dolphins' aquatic world to witness firsthand how they live their lives, communicate, and interact with one another and with other species, including people. Kathleen M. Dudzinski and Toni Frohoff are scientists who have collectively dedicated more than 40 years to studying dolphins beneath the ocean's surface, frequently through a close-up underwater lens. Drawing on their own experiences and on up-to-the-minute research, the authors show that dolphins are decidedly not just members of a group but distinct individuals, able to communicate with one another and with humans. Dudzinski and Frohoff introduce a new way of looking at, and listening to, the vocabulary of dolphins in the sea, and they even provide an introductory ""dolphin dictionary,"" listing complex social signals that dolphins use to share information among themselves and with people.

kjUXEAAAQBAJ,Count Down,"How Our Modern World Is Threatening Sperm Counts, Altering Male and Female Reproductive Development, and Imperiling the Future of the Human Race","Shanna H. Swan, Stacey Colino",Scribner,2021-02-23,"In the tradition of Silent Spring and The Sixth Extinction, an urgent, “disturbing, empowering, and essential” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) book about the ways in which chemicals in the modern environment are changing—and endangering—human sexuality and fertility on the grandest scale, from renowned epidemiologist Shanna Swan. In 2017, author Shanna Swan and her team of researchers completed a major study. They found that over the past four decades, sperm levels among men in Western countries have dropped by more than 50 percent. They came to this conclusion after examining 185 studies involving close to 45,000 healthy men. The result sent shockwaves around the globe—but the story didn’t end there. It turns out our sexual development is changing in broader ways, for both men and women and even other species, and that the modern world is on pace to become an infertile one. How and why could this happen? What is hijacking our fertility and our health? Count Down unpacks these questions, revealing what Swan and other researchers have learned about how both lifestyle and chemical exposures are affecting our fertility, sexual development—potentially including the increase in gender fluidity—and general health as a species. Engagingly explaining the science and repercussions of these worldwide threats and providing simple and practical guidelines for effectively avoiding chemical goods (from water bottles to shaving cream) both as individuals and societies, Count Down is “staggering in its findings” (Erin Brockovich, The Guardian) and “will serve as an awakening” (The New York Times Book Review).",304.0,Science,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=kjUXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=88&source=gbs_api,,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kjUXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
majqAQAAQBAJ,The Sugar Season,"A Year in the Life of Maple Syrup, and One Family's Quest for the Sweetest Harvest",Douglas Whynott,Da Capo Press,2014-03-04,"A year in the life of one New England family as they work to preserve an ancient, lucrative, and threatened agricultural art--the sweetest harvest, maple syrup . . . How has one of America's oldest agricultural crafts evolved from a quaint enterprise with ""sugar parties"" and the delicacy ""sugar on snow"" to a modern industry? At a sugarhouse owned by maple syrup entrepreneur Bruce Bascom, 80,000 gallons of sap are processed daily during winter's end. In The Sugar Season, Douglas Whynott follows Bascom through one tumultuous season, taking us deep into the sugarbush, where sunlight and sap are intimately related and the sound of the taps gives the woods a rhythm and a ring. Along the way, he reveals the inner workings of the multimillion-dollar maple sugar industry. Make no mistake, it's big business -- complete with a Maple Hall of Fame, a black market, a major syrup heist monitored by Homeland Security, a Canadian organization called The Federation, and a Global Strategic Reserve that's comparable to OPEC (fitting, since a barrel of maple syrup is worth more than a barrel of oil). Whynott brings us to sugarhouses, were we learn the myriad subtle flavors of syrup and how it's assigned a grade. He examines the unusual biology of the maple tree that makes syrup possible and explores the maples' -- and the industry's -- chances for survival, highlighting a hot-button issue: how global warming is threatening our food supply. Experts predict that, by the end of this century, maple syrup production in the United States may suffer a drastic decline. As buckets and wooden spouts give way to vacuum pumps and tubing, we see that even the best technology can't overcome warm nights in the middle of a season--and that only determined men like Bascom can continue to make a sweet like off of rugged land./DIV",305.0,Nature,en,,,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=majqAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=89&source=gbs_api,,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=majqAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

q0aM5t5GMpsC,The End of Nature,,Bill McKibben,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2006-06-13,"Reissued on the tenth anniversary of its publication, this classic work on our environmental crisis features a new introduction by the author, reviewing both the progress and ground lost in the fight to save the earth. This impassioned plea for radical and life-renewing change is today still considered a groundbreaking work in environmental studies. McKibben's argument that the survival of the globe is dependent on a fundamental, philosophical shift in the way we relate to nature is more relevant than ever. McKibben writes of our earth's environmental cataclysm, addressing such core issues as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer. His new introduction addresses some of the latest environmental issues that have risen during the 1990s. The book also includes an invaluable new appendix of facts and figures that surveys the progress of the environmental movement. More than simply a handbook for survival or a doomsday catalog of scientific prediction, this classic, soulful lament on Nature is required reading for nature enthusiasts, activists, and concerned citizens alike.",226.0,Nature,en,4.0,2.0,http://books.google.com.br/books?id=q0aM5t5GMpsC&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=166&source=gbs_api,,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q0aM5t5GMpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

This book shows us that animals think, feel and know in much the same way as we do.”—Sy Montgomery, bestselling author of The Soul of an Octopus Through vivid stories of devoted pigs, two-timing magpies, and scheming roosters, The Inner Life of Animals weaves the latest scientific research into how animals interact with the world with Peter Wohlleben's personal experiences in forests and fields. We learn that horses feel shame, deer grieve, and goats discipline their kids. Ravens call their friends by name, rats regret bad choices, and butterflies choose the very best places for their children to grow up. In this captivating book, Peter Wohlleben follows the hugely successful The Hidden Life of Trees with insightful stories into the emotions, feelings, and intelligence of animals around us. Animals are different from us in ways that amaze us—and they are also much closer to us than we ever would have thought. “Wry, avuncular, careful and kind. . .

This series grabs you with book one and doesn't let go!--Wall Street Journal Detective Virgil Jones, leader of the Major Crimes Unit tackles the hard cases. 'The good stuff' his boss likes to call it. Except there's nothing good about his latest case. Nothing at all. A team of serial snipers are on the loose...their civilian victims chosen at random. Or are they? With no witnesses and very little evidence, the Major Crimes Unit is ordered to find and stop the killers by any means necessary. Except when Virgil's long-lost adopted brother, a convicted felon named Murton Wheeler comes back to town, in trouble and on the run, Virgil knows it's more than just coincidence. He can't prove it...in fact, he's not even sure he wants to. As the bodies continue to mount, Virgil finds himself running out of options, knowing he has to choose where his true loyalties lie...with the people he's sworn to protect, or to the brother that left him behind when he needed him the most. But in the end Virgil discovers he never really had a choice, because the final bullet reveals a truth that will change his life forever. ""This is Crime fiction at its finest...a Thriller filled with mystery, suspense, humor and a touch of romance as well!""

Y8vIzQEACAAJ,Painting the Light,A Novel,Sally Cabot Gunning,William Morrow,2021-06,"From the critically acclaimed author of Monticello and The Widow's War comes a vividly rendered historical novel of love, loss, and reinvention, set on Martha's Vineyard at the turn of the nineteenth century. Martha's Vineyard, 1898. In her first life, Ida Russell had been a painter. Five years ago, she had confidently walked the halls of Boston's renowned Museum School, enrolling in art courses that were once deemed ""unthinkable"" for women to take, and showing a budding talent for watercolors. But no more. Ida Russell is now Ida Pease, resident of a seaside farm on Vineyard Haven, and wife to Ezra, a once-charming man who has become an inattentive and altogether unreliable husband. Ezra runs a salvage company in town with his business partner Mose Barstow, but he much prefers their nightly card games at the local pub to his work in their Boston office, not to mention filling haystacks and tending sheep on the farm at home--duties that have fallen to Ida and their part-time farmhand Lem. Ida, meanwhile, has left her love for painting behind. It comes as no surprise to Ida when Ezra is hours late for a Thanksgiving dinner, only to leave abruptly for another supposedly urgent business trip to Boston. But then something truly unthinkable happens: a storm strikes, and the Portland sinks. Ezra and Mose are presumed dead. In the wake of this shocking tragedy, Ida must settle the affairs of Ezra's estate, a task that brings her to a familiar face from her past--Henry Barstow, Mose's brother and executor.
